v12 Configuration — KIBC + M (retrieval) dual-layer architecture.

V12 adds the M (match/retrieval) kernel as a *layer type*, not a 5th
combinator in the KIBC dispatch softmax. The insight from session 095:
Qwen3.6-35B-A3B accidentally separates composition (full attention at
every 4th layer) from retrieval (GatedDeltaNet between). The induction
circuit (J=0.176 with everything else) lives exclusively in the linear
attention layers — it's mechanistically independent.

V12 makes this separation intentional:
  - Composition layers: StrideStack (windowed attention) — KIBC lives here
  - Retrieval layers: GatedLinearAttention — M lives here
  - HybridStrideStack: interleaves both, configurable per stride

Design principle — SEPARATION ENABLES HOLOGRAPHY (session 096):
  Cross-architecture analysis (Pythia, Qwen3, SmolLM3, 7 models) proved:
    - MLP/FFN: universally holographic (score 0.97, CV 0.025)
    - Attention output: universally holographic (score 0.94, CV 0.020)
    - Separate Q/K/V: holographic (score 0.92, Qwen3/SmolLM3)
    - Fused QKV: magnitude-dependent (score 0.60, Pythia)
  Multiplexing functions into shared weights forces magnitudes to act
  as "lenses" steering beams between subspaces. Separation lets each
  weight encode one function as pure sign topology.
  → V12: every projection is separate. Every weight has one job.

Architecture:
  Ascending arm: HybridStrideStack (interleaved composition + retrieval)
  Descending arm: KIBC combinator dispatch + retrieval register access
  7 passes: L0↑ → L1↑ → L2↑ → L3_apex → L2↓ → L1↓ → L0↓
  Output: tied embedding projection → next-token prediction

Carries forward from v11:
  - KIBC combinator basis (4-way softmax, not 5)
  - VSM hierarchy (S1-S5, algedonic, CycleContinue)
  - Holographic loss (progressive intermediate decoding)
  - Abstraction slots (S4→S5 proposals)
  - Fractal stride bands (MERA topology)
