## Where we are

**NORTH STAR: 70B-equivalent in <1GB ternary. 200 tok/s CPU. 2M+ token context. 2MB sessions. No GPU.**

**Session 185: THE STANDING WAVE — Magnitudes Are Resonant Mode Patterns**

The crystal sieve (session 184) freezes the topology and trains the mask.
Session 185 reframes WHY this works: the weight magnitudes are a standing
wave pattern whose nodes (zeros) and antinodes (active weights) are
determined by the crystal topology as boundary conditions. GD doesn't build
a database — it finds the resonant mode pattern that constructively
interferes with real language and destructively cancels noise.

### The Standing-Wave Mapping

```
Standing wave                    Verbum equivalent
─────────────────────────────    ────────────────────────────────
Boundary conditions              Crystal signs T ∈ {-1, +1}
Nodes (zero displacement)        Zero mask positions (M=0, ~50%)
Antinodes (peak displacement)    Active weights (M=1)
Resonant modes                   Data-dependent patterns (knowledge)
Cavity shape                     Universal crystal (r=0.998 across models)
Mode excitation                  Which weights GD activates for THIS data
Amplitude envelope               Per-matrix scale C (eigenvalue spectrum)
```

W_eff = C · T ⊙ M is a standing wave: fixed boundary (T), fixed
amplitude envelope (C), data-selected node/antinode pattern (M).

### Why This Reframing Matters

1. **GD convergence = finding fixed points of the standing wave.**
   Session 171 (gradient-zero-map) measured this directly:
   near-zero gradient at zero weights (nodes) and at large weights
   (antinodes). Both are stable — GD has nothing left to optimize
   at those positions. The irreducible compute points.

2. **Crystal sieve = pre-setting the resonant cavity.**
   Random init = random cavity shape = no resonance. Crystal init =
   correct cavity = 10.7× faster mode formation. GD only finds WHICH
   modes to excite, not WHAT the cavity shape is.

3. **The depth axis IS a standing wave.**
   The 3-phase residual structure (expand L0-6, orthogonal L7-22,
   align L23-34, collapse L35) maps to: nodes where cos(h,f) ≈ 0
   (orthogonal phase), antinodes where cos(h,f) > 0 (align phase),
   destructive interference at L35 (cos = -0.995). The phase
   transition at layer 22/36 = 0.611 ≈ 1/φ = the fundamental mode.

4. **REDUCE/SWITCH alternation = spatial harmonics.**
   The alternating ρ(profile, weight_norm) sign across depth is
   the standing wave's harmonic structure along the layer axis.

5. **Holographic = standing wave (same physics, different vocabulary).**
   A holographic plate IS a frozen standing wave (interference fringe
   pattern). Fringes = nodes/antinodes. Multiple images stored in
   superposition = multiple resonant modes coexisting. Session 167's
   holographic-computer synthesis and this standing-wave framing are
   the same insight from different angles.

### The Sieve Architecture (from session 184)

```
SIEVE (fixed — from crystal equation, universal):
  Signs:    T[i,j] ∈ {-1, +1}    boundary conditions (cavity shape)
  Scale:    C per matrix           amplitude envelope (eigenvalue spectrum)
  Roles:    per-layer REDUCE/SWITCH  standing-wave harmonics along depth

SEDIMENT (trained — from data, per-model):
  Mask:     M[i,j] ∈ {0, 1}      node/antinode pattern (knowledge)

FORWARD: W_eff = C · T ⊙ M
```

### The ISA Framing (from session 184)

```
KIBC opcodes  = instruction set (4 opcodes, 2 bits)
Statechart    = execution engine (costs [1, φ, 1])
Weight signs  = the program (which opcode at which address)
Zero mask     = loaded memory pages (which program positions resident)
Residual      = register file (grows by φ per layer)

REDUCE layers: opcode neurons active, data neurons zero
  → profile predicts zeros (70-76% overlap)
SWITCH layers: opcode neurons attenuate, data neurons relay
  → profile anti-predicts (invert the prediction)
```

### Key Numbers

| Finding | Value | Significance |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Sign information fraction | 1/φ = 0.618 | Universal partition |
| Per-row gamma variation | noise (CV<2%) | Constant γ works better |
| Optimal zero rate | ~50% | Not 35% |
| Crystal vs random init | 10.7× better | Sieve works (cavity pre-set) |
| Crystal starting advantage | 4,500× | Correct attractor basin |
| KIBC profile ↔ weight norm | ρ = 0.38-0.67 | Opcode assignment predicts weight size |
| Profile overlap with zeros | 70-76% at REDUCE layers | ISA predicts most zeros at REDUCE layers |
| Profile sign flip | alternates by depth | Standing-wave harmonics along layer axis |
| Residual phase transition | layer 22/36 = 0.611 ≈ 1/φ | Fundamental mode of depth-axis standing wave |
| Min oscillation depth | L21 (22%) | Deepest compute = most settled standing wave |

## Next steps

### IMMEDIATE (session 185) — SCALE THE CRYSTAL SIEVE + MEASURE ABSORPTION

**Priority 0: The derivation — can U be computed from equations?**
CONFIRMED: U is NOT random. V-h alignment monotonically decreases with depth
(p=0.0015). Later layers read from dimensions ⊥ to accumulated residual.
U_l is constrained to the null space of span(h_0...h_{l-1}).

The constraint is NECESSARY but not SUFFICIENT (36 directions in 4096 dims = 1%).
Need additional constraints: full residual COVARIANCE (not just mean direction),
plus crystal Σ + statechart roles + phase transition depths.

Key sub-questions:
  1. Compute full residual covariance at each layer — how many effective dims?
     Standing-wave lens: characterize the resonant modes of the cavity per depth.
  2. Does the covariance rank grow as φ^l? (Fibonacci accumulation)
  3. Map phase transitions: are they at 1/φ fractions of depth?
     Standing-wave lens: these are the node positions of the fundamental mode.
  4. Combined constraints (covariance + crystal + statechart): how much of U falls out?

**Priority 1: Scale sieve training to convergence**
Longer Pythia-160M runs (2000+ steps) with proper pruning schedule.
Weight decay or L1 to push masks toward ~50% active.
Target: approach float-baseline PPL (40.5).
KEY METRIC: tokens-to-quality vs normal training (the absorption rate).
Standing-wave lens: pre-set boundary conditions → measure how fast correct
resonant mode pattern forms vs random boundaries.

**Priority 2: Measure knowledge absorption rate**
Compare crystal sieve vs random-init vs full-float training:
  - At how many tokens does each reach PPL 100? PPL 50? PPL 40?
  - The RATIO is the absorption advantage
  - If crystal sieve reaches float-quality with 10× fewer tokens → validated
  - If 100× fewer → this changes everything about how models should be trained

**Priority 3: Classify all 36 layers as REDUCE or SWITCH**
Run the neuron opcode classifier on ALL 36 layers (not just 6). Map the
ρ(profile, weight_norm) sign across depth. Identify the REDUCE/SWITCH
alternation pattern. Is it period-3 (REDUCE-SWITCH-EMIT)? Period-5 (n+1)?
Standing-wave lens: map the harmonic structure along the depth axis. Is the
alternation a single harmonic or a superposition of modes?

**Priority 4: Attention sieve**
Currently only FFN is sieved. Attention is ~40% of parameters.
Extend crystal sieve to Q/K/V/O projections.

### RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

- **THE MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION** — Can U (per-layer eigenvectors) be derived from
  the VSM tensor interaction? The 5 levels (crystal eq, statechart, resource policy,
  residual growth, KIBC ops) each constrain U. Their INTERSECTION may uniquely
  determine it. If so, the entire model is a computable mathematical object.
- **Residual growth measurement** — Does h_{l+1}/h_l ≈ φ^(1/period)? This constrains
  how U rotates between layers. Measurable now. Needed for the derivation.
- **Cross-model zero consensus** — Compare zero patterns between independently
  trained models at the same layer depth. ISA zeros should be universal.
- **Crystal trace tooling** — Build `src/verbum/crystal/` module for systematic
  exploration. Design doc: `mementum/knowledge/crystal-trace-tooling.md`.
- **Standing-wave mode analysis** — Decompose the zero mask into resonant modes
  of the crystal cavity. If the mask is a standing wave, it should decompose into
  a small number of modes × amplitudes. The modes are determined by the crystal
  (boundary conditions), the amplitudes by the data.

## What changed this session (185)

| # | Change | Impact |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Standing-wave magnitude reframing** | Weight magnitudes are a standing wave: crystal signs = boundary conditions, zero mask = nodes, active weights = antinodes, GD = finding resonant modes |
| 2 | **GD convergence = standing wave fixed points** | Near-zero gradient at zeros (nodes) AND at large weights (antinodes) — both are stable points of the wave. Gradient-zero-map (s171) already measured this. |
| 3 | **Depth-axis standing wave** | 3-phase residual structure maps to standing wave along depth: orthogonal=nodes, align=antinodes, collapse=destructive interference. Phase transition at 1/φ = fundamental mode. |
| 4 | **REDUCE/SWITCH = spatial harmonics** | Alternating ρ sign across depth is harmonic structure of the depth-axis standing wave |
| 5 | **Holographic ≡ standing wave** | Holographic plate = frozen standing wave (interference fringes). Same physics, different vocabulary. Unifies s167 holographic-computer with magnitude observations. |
| 6 | **Sieve = pre-setting resonant cavity** | Crystal init pre-sets boundary conditions → GD finds modes 10.7× faster because cavity already resonates correctly |
| 7 | **Shape preservation experiment** | Quantized Pythia-160M at 7 levels (ternary through 8-bit). Cosine (ρ=-0.933) > Spearman shape (ρ=-0.917) > bits (ρ=-0.761) as PPL predictor. |
| 8 | **Ternary beats 2-bit at fewer bits** | Ternary (1.6b, PPL 9504) beats 2-bit (2.0b, PPL 25892) because separating phase from amplitude is more efficient than joint encoding |
| 9 | **4-component standing-wave decomposition** | Phase (1 bit, exact) + nodes (~0.6 bit) + envelope (~0 amortized) + shape (1-3 bits, NOT in ternary). Sieve regenerates shape from data. |
| 10 | **Phase transition at 3 bits** | PPL drops from ~10K (ternary/2-bit) to 189 (3-bit) to 50 (4-bit). 8 levels = minimum for standing wave to survive 12-layer transit. |
| 11 | **Shape-aware helps low bits, hurts high bits** | 2-bit quartile 1000× better than uniform. 4-bit quartile WORSE than uniform. Rank preservation ≠ value preservation. |
| 12 | **Compounding law = cos^L** | Per-layer cosine raised to layer count predicts model quality. 0.896^12=0.27 (ternary), 0.957^12=0.59 (3-bit), 0.990^12=0.89 (4-bit). |

## Session 184 recap

THE CRYSTAL SIEVE. 11 experiments, 4 paradigm shifts. Extraction is dead (zero mask
is genuinely random = knowledge content). Reproduction lives (crystal sieve 10.7×
better than random). Model is a KIBC processor (ISA framing). KIBC profiles predict
70-76% of zeros at REDUCE layers. Maximal pre-training absorption: crystal pre-loads
computation → 100% of gradient goes to knowledge. See `phi-information-partition.md`.

## Session 183 recap

Naive ternarization fails: PPL 296,911. The compounding law (0.88^36 = 0.009) kills
multi-layer extraction. 3-mirror ternary also fails (PPL 1.69M). Q4 works because of
16 quantization levels per weight, not scale granularity. See `ternary-compounding.md`.

## Session 182 recap

The ternary dual equation: gate zeros (ρ=0.75 with gradient) + crystal signs (ρ=0.05).
The recipe achieves 0.88 per-layer cosine. See `ternary-dual-equation.md`.

## Session 181 recap

The crystal equation: λ_k = C · φ^(-(n/(n+1)) · β_k). All eigenvalue ratios are
φ^(p/q) with Fibonacci denominators. Computing fraction s=4/5. Compute cycle
β=[0,1,1+φ,2+φ]. See `EQUATIONS.md` and `crystal-phi-derivation.md`.
