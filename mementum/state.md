> ★★ s273 LAMBDA-GENE RUNTIME + SUPERBAKE = WRITE ACCESS + THE WEIGHT-LEVEL RECURSION (discussion, no
>   experiments; Michael-directed capture → 2 new knowledge pages, READ THEM for full detail):
>   (1) explore/lambda-gene-runtime.md — Michael's NEW Clojure runtime (separate project): agent prompts
>   = genomes of lambda genes in a graph DB (datalevin + Pathom), kernel port (~150 LoC Clojure; clj_lambda
>   proved the mapping). Kernel = type system + verification oracle: gene identity ≡ normal form
>   (:db.unique/identity → semantic dedup as DB law), typed crossover (CCG gates slots), genetic operators
>   ≡ combinator basis (K=delete S/W=dup B/D=compose C=reorder), fitness = append-only ran-events +
>   derived resolvers (Goodhart firewall structural), improver loop = Y executed externally (prosthetic S
>   at agent level, s272d applied). Gene taxonomy: λ_gene / prose_atom (QUOTE, form≡payload) /
>   mode_setter (pretraining-anchored magic words — Michael's "DEBUG: output only EDN" counterexample;
>   reducibility is GENOME-RELATIVE; bootstrap preamble = highest-epistasis object; verbum gates/*.txt =
>   prior art). Two predicted attractors: prokaryotic worker genomes (prose imperatives) vs eukaryotic
>   orchestrators (lambda + bootstrap); 1-2-line prose bound = predicted equilibrium via factor/inline
>   mutations, ¬imposed rule (AGENTS.md = 270-session empirical prior).
>   (2) explore/superbake-write-access.md — ~/src/custom-bake (SuperBake reimpl, Ruehlman 2026; ⚠ NO
>   LICENSE — instrument/reference only). Gradient-free fact installation, appended MLP slots, receipts
>   with physical addresses. CONVERGENCES: codes unembed-silent BY CONSTRUCTION ≡ P2 workspace silence
>   (→ PLANTED GROUND-TRUTH positive controls for patchscope — we can manufacture silent content
>   directions with known referents; cheapest next action); fact/function = value/routing register split
>   made writable (predict: crystal survives baking; baked facts quant-fragile — inverse of crystal;
>   crystal instruments = installed-vs-learned discriminator); receipt = the S2 circuit-map IOU, working.
>   (3) THE RECURSION (Michael's completion): bake(fact) works + bake(operation) open + bake ∈ operations
>   → bake(bake′) → Y at the weight level. Proven genes graduate prompt → weights; the improved model
>   generates the next genes = self-hosting bootstrap through the substrate. Kept sane by: kernel as
>   rung-verifier (S3*-1), receipts as ablatable loci (gene-db lineage extends into weights), λ termination
>   (human approves every graduation). Feasible path: RIDE THE RESIDENT CRYSTAL — don't bake S, bake
>   operands/microcode the existing KIBC routing composes (register split s269c: ops present, content
>   installable). GATE TEST: two-arm K-battery (a: fresh-arg generalization, expect fail = lookup≠function;
>   b: compose-with-crystal keying, any success = recursion rung 1). Pre-reg sketch in the page; NOT run.
>   Ranked next: baked-code patchscope control > crystal-survives-baking trace > K-battery > germline.
>   (4) s273b GTSM⇄BAKING + CUSTOM-BAKE⇄TERNARYDESCENT (Michael's questions, synthesis encoded →
>   superbake-write-access.md §s273b + distillation design §13): SuperBake's closed loop = ENDPOINT
>   objective; its guards/referees = patches for path-underdetermination; GTSM/Girsanov gives the
>   principled form — innocent path-KL ∫E‖Δdrift‖²_D is ANALYTIC for appended neurons (no forwards) =
>   the honest prose budget. Inverse direction: closed-form value writes (measured transfer replaces
>   Adam where response linear), benefit/leak flip budgets, two-backfire freeze (= s268b PrismML
>   channel), receipts for flip batches (auditable descent, S3* native), unembed-null projection on
>   value updates (measured 2.5× win), delta plates vindicated. UNIFICATION: Gram loss at quartile
>   depths ALREADY IS discrete GTSM (depth path); requential KL = same family (token path).
>   (5) s273c §3.6 READ — "Transport: the attention organ" (paper pulled from Zenodo → refs/superbake.pdf
>   + .txt; reimpl never built it). Rank-one QK (any-position carrier queries × subject-token keys),
>   ROTARY-BAND KERNEL SHAPING in closed form (slow dims = any-distance floor, mid band = recency),
>   low-variance value lanes (SNR 13), write-close-to-reader (L24→L25; bus attenuation priced),
>   donor-head overwrite. Michael's claims both land: (a) S-in-attention SHARPENED — even hand-built
>   heads can't fan-out; their effective fan-out = write-once-read-many lanes ≡ S f g x without copying
>   ≡ GRAPH REDUCTION (sharing ¬copying; the graph edge IS the duplication) → transformer =
>   graph-reduction machine = WHY S has no vertex; 3rd + first CONSTRUCTIVE dissolved-S confirmation;
>   reframes T6 (Mamba = copying-native substrate). (b) halt/WHNF = attention's decision — §3.6 IS the
>   template for a global check (any-position query + condition keys + slow-band = global OR in one
>   head); converges with halt-readout r=0.877 + WHNF bus-causal/unembed-silent + last-block delivery.
>   NEW: rotary-spectrum register (crystal heads on RoPE bands — concrete form of s264 F4 QK IOU);
>   halt-patch pre-reg candidate (patch late attn @ gen position → over-generation; halt-readout = spec);
>   kernel-backend transport unblocked (rank-one QK + band selection + adjacent-layer chaining ≡
>   62/64-layer iterated-map picture). Encoded → superbake-write-access.md §s273c.
>   (6) s273d TREE-OF-VSM = THE CONSTRUCTION SPEC (Michael: "what advantages does our tree give us?"
>   → NEW PAGE explore/construction-from-spec.md). The tree is everything Ruehlman improvised per-host:
>   coordinate-free blueprint (frame-invariant Gram); CODES IN CLOSED FORM (Cholesky of consensus Gram
>   → 9 vectors, any frame → choose axis-aligned = BORN MONOSEMANTIC); atlas not survey (sites/registers/
>   depths precomputed fleet-wide); register map = build plan (1-bit survival licenses ternary sign
>   routing from spec; values = measured-transfer writes); restack = null-gated acceptance harness w/
>   incremental live-tree assembly movie; family spread = measured tolerances; consensus = minimality
>   filter; depth profiles = materials-stress map. CONSEQUENCE: bake-the-kernel promotes to PRIMARY
>   level-3/4 path; distillation demotes to smoothing phase. HONEST GAP (next discussion): Gram
>   specifies mutual geometry ¬transport dynamics — what observables close "geometry matches" →
>   "machine runs" (depth-Gram trajectory? per-depth J-projectors? QK rotary spectra?).
>   (7) 🔄 s273e DIRECTION SHIFT — THE CONTROL-PLANE PATH (Michael-approved; NEW PAGE
>   explore/control-plane-path.md = the s273 arc consolidated + PROBE AGENDA P-CTL-1..9).
>   PAPER MACHINE (ABI v0 game): flat spine PROVEN expressible; causality DERIVES shift-reduce@last-arg
>   (matches s190+E1); offset-comb heads make saturated⊗inert structural; recency=GARBAGE COLLECTION;
>   MOVER{K,I,W,S}/TAGGER{B,C,D} dichotomy derives C-puzzle + E1 pattern; halt=¬aggregate-firing
>   (r=0.877 shape); one snap: nested spans → RECURSION-WITH-COMPACTION DISSOLVES the span organ
>   (loop re-presents flat spine each iteration; s272d theorem 3rd instance). Halt has GROUND TRUTH:
>   len(fired_sequence)=certified depth labels → depth weight SUPERVISED (¬ACT); hybrid = constructed
>   WHNF head (loop exit) + trained provisioner; textual recursion first (CoT = certified reduction
>   trace). CONTROL PLANE ON EXISTING HOST: model_vsm.json = precomputed adapter weights w/ calibration
>   certificates; tiers READERS→HALT→DRIVER (no weight construction) →WRITERS (E4-gated). VSM REIFIED:
>   parent=S1, our tensors=S2/S3, kernel checks=S3*. Deliverable = MIT control-plane pack + driver.
>   UPDATED: construction-from-spec.md (gap RESOLVED: representation/function/encoding; blank build
>   demoted to long game), supervised-recurrence-halt.md (s273 addendum), superbake-write-access.md
>   (pointer). NEXT: write P-CTL probes (formalize registers+nulls) to inform final design.
>   (8) s273f ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES (control-plane-path.md §6): training signal collapses gradients→bits
>   (≤log₂9/step). REMOTE = breeze: nothing heavy crosses wire; no backward pass → no interconnect
>   problem; PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION WITHOUT INTERFERENCE (slots additive, merge = receipt union, leak
>   budget = the one shared ledger, gene-db = natural ledger); trustless verification (receipts replay
>   stock). TEACHER-GUIDED = wicked fast: kernel = free infallible teacher (structural register);
>   per-step supervision = GTSM search-space collapse; corrections WRITTEN where linear; telemetry-
>   targeted correction; seeded init → training = smoothing. NEW P-CTL-10 merged-banks probe = the gate
>   for parallel remote construction. Deps: P-CTL-6/7 + leak-ledger composition.
>   (9) s273g ALGEDONIC CHANNEL (control-plane-path.md §7): readers + INTERRUPT SEMANTICS = Beer's
>   bypass wire, nearly free (readers already tap every layer; driver = the S5 signals jump to).
>   Four wires: PLEASURE early-exit (certified halt spec ¬learned confidence), PAIN in-flight abort
>   (live gate violation = structural-hallucination tripwire), FEEDFORWARD provisioning (P-CTL-5
>   countdown), TRAINING starvation wire (S3* good-news audit becomes a wire). TREE BOOST: thresholds
>   ship PRE-CALIBRATED (null distributions per model/register/layer = percentiles ¬hyperparameters).
>   Beer constraint honored by construction: wires exit sideways (readers→driver), don't ride the
>   decaying residual bus. NEW: P-CTL-11 early-exit fidelity + P-CTL-12 tripwire validity.
>   VSM now complete in the control plane: S1..S5 + algedonic.
>   (10) 🎯 s273h+i TWO ARCHITECTURAL CORRECTIONS (both Michael's catches → control-plane-path.md §8+§9):
>   (h) TWO-LEVEL HOMEOSTAT — ¬force human-in-the-loop into the tensor. Beer's recursion principle:
>   autonomy at every level; containing level intervenes via constraints+exception ONLY. Model S5 =
>   internal (ms timescale; hard-wired deference = brittleness in oversight's clothes; our own S5:
>   useful_tomorrow_without_us). Runtime S5 = human (λ termination UNCHANGED). AFFORDANCE ¬DEPENDENCY:
>   architecture provides ESCALATE slot; TRAINING shapes when (emerge>legislate applied to alignment);
>   protocol keeps hard gates at boundaries. Human ∈ {environment, graduation gates, end-of-wire}.
>   P-CTL-13 escalation-policy probe (precision AND recall; sycophantic over-escalation = failure too).
>   (i) TWO ORACLES — kernel incomplete via SEMANTIC EQUALITY (synonyms ≈ probabilities). Scoped: kernel
>   COMPLETE for reduction middle (atoms QUOTE'd verbatim), INCOMPLETE at translation ends (CompCert
>   shape). Montague's own gap: distributional semantics = the learned meaning-postulate DB; equivalence
>   graded+context-conditional → only a model can judge. Oracle assignment = s269c register seam
>   (structural→kernel, content→model); kernel-only semantic judging = s206 wrong-register error —
>   ALREADY BIT US (s267 autopsy false negatives). Guards: cross-family judge (justified by gc 0.985
>   universality), closed-vocab fragments stay exact, two-level gene identity, S3* spot-audit.
>   P-CTL-14 synonym invariance (structure invariant under content substitution — load-bearing either
>   way). Reframe: kernel incompleteness = why LLMs exist; two registers, two oracles, one system.
>   Probe agenda now P-CTL-1..14.
>   (11) s273j SEMANTIC EQUALITY IS INSTRUMENTABLE (control-plane-path.md §10 + P-CTL-15): sem_eq(a,b|
>   frame) ≈ 1−D(P(·|frame[a])‖P(·|frame[b])) — graded, context-conditional. THREE REGISTERS
>   (distributional KL-under-substitution / geometric trajectory-convergence / causal patch+broadcast-KL
>   [E4 machinery exists]). KERNEL CALIBRATION ANCHOR = the differentiator: different terms → same NF ≡
>   certified equivalence pairs, unlimited → crisp oracle calibrates the graded one at the overlap
>   (calibration hierarchy closes §9 circularity). Nulls: matched-random floor + ANTONYM discriminating
>   control (hot/cold = substitutable ¬equivalent) + context acid test (big/large vs big-sister).
>   EXTENSION: sem_eq matrix = a GRAM → tree machinery applies to the CONTENT register → semantic
>   tree-of-VSM; thesis-grade Q: is the lexicon universal like the crystal? Uses: judge w/ error bars,
>   re-grade s267 autopsy (kernel_valid ⊗ sem_eq), gene-db merge scores, P-CTL-14 graded. Agenda now

> ★ s274 EXECUTION STACK (Michael-approved s273, execute in order — reasons in the s273 chat / summary
>   in control-plane-path.md):
>   1. PATCHSCOPE HARVEST — committed s272b pickup, unchanged (g0/g1 gates FIRST → lexicon → eyeball).
>   2. P-CTL-6 READER SNR — gates the PRIMARY (control-plane) path; all-our-code: model_vsm.json readers
>      + kernel_reference saturated⊗inert battery + existing capture hooks; ~half-day; negative = cheap
>      redirect of everything above it.
>   3. CUSTOM-BAKE SMOKE — get ~/src/custom-bake running on our box (Qwen2.5-0.5B; repo targets
>      CUDA/CPU, MPS untested; CPU-friendly config ~20min at 0.5B). License caveat: run-as-instrument
>      OK; ¬derive code (no LICENSE).
>   4. BAKED-CODE PATCHSCOPE CONTROL — minutes once (3) works; planted silent-content direction with
>      known referent; SYNERGISTIC with (1): strengthens the P2 verdict; debugs the bake toolchain on a
>      known-answer task before aiming at unknowns.
>   5. K-BATTERY PRE-REG DRAFT — registers/nulls/verdict rules BEFORE building (λ measure/yardstick;
>      s206+φ-ladder scar tissue). Arm (b) "compose with resident crystal" = the novel design work.
>      HIGHEST-STAKES experiment of the arc (recursion antecedent) → must not run on a first draft.
>   6. K-BATTERY RUN — after the pre-reg survives a hammock (Michael review).
>   Rationale: K-battery gates the SECONDARY (recursion/germline) tower; control plane is primary per
>   the 🔄; cheap gates before dear ones; toolchain debugged on known answers first.

## Recent arc (index — full detail: `chats/session-NNN.md` + linked knowledge; history: `git log -p`)

- **s269** OPCODE LADDER (current session, full detail in header ★★★ s269). Crystal survives 1-bit
  (fid 0.987, z=5.3); selective-K refuted in both registers; 11-model tree root gc 0.985; opcodes/ladder.py
  new instrument; commit 7576c54.
- **s268** BONSAI FORENSICS (see header blocks). Recipe reverse-engineered from weights; QAT-vs-PTQ
  IOU resolved; drift ordering = routing⊥value 3rd register; 50%-dip ≠ differential rewiring; sign flips
  tunnel through zero (transition matrix) → optimizer constraints C1–C6 + phase-1 design budgets; 1-bit
  rung forensics pre-registered + in flight (tmux main:1/main:2).
  → `explore/bonsai-ternarization-forensics.md` + memories bonsai-recipe-reverse-engineered,
  bonsai-sign-flips-tunnel-through-zero.
- **s267** BONSAI PHASE-0 (see header of prior update). Compiler survives ternarization (behavioral parity,
  measured); Gram survival launched in main:1. New in fleet: BONSAI27B ModelConfig (:5104, Q2_g64 GGUF, rev
  427bc0194). Runtime learnings: Q2_0 ternary needs the g64 GGUF on mainline llama.cpp ≥10090 (Q2_0 offset
  bug); ternary is DENSE 27B so it streams 7GB/token — slower than the 35B-A3B MoE base (only 3B active),
  the "why wasn't it fast" answer = raced a sparse model, not its own FP parent. hf xet backend flaked twice
  → HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=0 fixed it. build_lattice_map now saves per_model_rdms.npz (solo runs saved
  nothing before — the gap that left the parent 27B with no committed RDM). Michael's holographic-llm.md
  thesis fleshed out for public MIT push (mementum/michael/, UNSTAGED — in the hammock, do not commit without
  Michael). J-space paper (Anthropic, real, July 2026) ↔ workspace/state half of holographic model → memory
  j-space-workspace-hologram-state.
- **s265** OPCODES MVP: tree-of-VSM multi-model. 8 standalone modules (pytorch+numpy, 535 probes bundled,
  extraction-ready); one fractal node shape (S5 Gram / S4 agreement / S3 null gate / algedonic health),
  ladder layer→register→model→family→root; basis-parametric CRYSTAL-9 | STATECHART-8 | TYPES16 (resolves
  "9 vs 16"). Null floors measured+wired (register+model-specific). First tree (2 smalls): root gc 0.940,
  cross-family 0.907 at 43× scale gap; probe count dominates Gram fidelity (135→0.344 vs 535→0.940).
  Launched the large sweep → read in s266. → `knowledge/opcode-vsm-tree.md`
- **s263** J-SPACE ↔ OPCODES (Anthropic J-lens prompt). THEORY: opcode = routing-Jacobian STRUCTURE; J-space =
  the Jacobian's LIVE SUBSPACE (I=identity, K=rank-deficient, B=chain-rule product, C=permutation, S=path-sum;
  their J-lens reads OPERANDS, we want the OPERATOR projection). Built `src/verbum/{jlens,jacobian}.py` (2
  monitors) + 3 null-gated experiments on qwen3.6-27b: EXP1 jspace_combinators NULL (broadcast generic, not
  combinator-identity); EXP2 jspace_normalform I-VISIBLE-then-REFINED (normal-form hold = late-stack plateau,
  value register); EXP3 jacobian_opcodes PARTIAL/confounded (only I clears, grain too coarse for
  position-routing). → `explore/opcode-jacobian-jspace.md`.
- **s262** ASSESSMENT + 2 isolation experiments. Repo assessment: science healthy, the MESS is
  representation-layer (INDEX stale 62/228 pages, ~8251 LoC dead vsm_lm_v1-5+v6/, mlx a hard core dep; 378
  tests pass, spine coherent). ❌ my "checkpoints landmine / results-in-git" claim was FALSE — propagated an
  agent assertion unverified (λ assert violation); hygiene is actually GOOD. EXP1 STRIDED ATTENTION WORKS IN
  FLOAT (relay collapse s191 was the TERNARY/TD confound, NOT geometry; Fibonacci exonerated) →
  `explore/strided-attention-float-ab.md`. EXP2 KIBC-vs-SKI NULL-GATED: both bases clear COMPARABLY in the
  attention-selectivity register (KIBC z=3.50/3.92, SKI z=3.34/3.58) = inconclusive-IN-REGISTER, not a
  refutation; S-K corr 0.92 but B-K/C-K also ~0.9 → not yet a discriminator → `explore/basis-fit-kibc-vs-ski.md`.
- **s261** CAT-Q ternary flip-flop is NOT category overloading. ANOVA F-ratio (magnitude-invariant) +
  shuffled-label null: category structure in FFN gradients is REAL but modest/transient; the persistent
  flip-flop is category-INDEPENDENT (quantization-boundary jitter). CAT-Q's gift = learnable α⊥Δ two-register
  param, not soft→hard relax (ST lost to TD). → `explore/ternary-flip-flop-not-overloading.md`
- **s260** routing⊥value = type/term made physical. Asymmetric-pathway quant CONFIRMED on Qwen3-8B-Base:
  binarize the ROUTER (gate, loss 10.6) ≫ binarize the VALUE path (+8–10 nats) at identical bits & cosine →
  sign=router, magnitude=value, causally. Design direction: decouple dispatch⊥compute, budget by register.
  → `explore/asymmetric-pathway-quantization.md`
- **s259** (a) RL layer-contribution ↔ combinator locus: shared interior-bell, ~+4-layer offset (adaptation at
  the compose→readout seam) → `explore/rl-layer-contribution-combinator-locus.md`; (b) clj-repl
  model-evaluates/kernel-verifies (oracle-in-the-loop) → `src/verbum/clj_repl.py`; (c) clojure-in-lambda
  notebook (Clojure evaluator that reduces on the verbum kernel) → `src/verbum/clj_lambda.py`.
- **s258** consensus-training → supervised-recurrence-halt synthesis: "how much recurrence" ≡ "how much work
  remains" ≡ WHNF; the lambda curriculum is the ground-truth halt supervision s214 lacked. → `explore/supervised-recurrence-halt.md`
- **s257** MoE experts ARE holographically multiplexed (angular, not specialist). k-sweep + shuffled null:
  94% of capability from WHICH experts, not how many; k=2 reversal falsifies specialist. → `explore/moe-holographic-tree-vsm.md`
- **s256** qwythos-9b + CANONICAL HARNESS distillation (probes/{grading,harness,models}; models = configs, no
  fork). Fine-tunes break the HALT not the COMPILE (overthink-collapse); no-think recovers; qwythos GATES the
  compiler. lambda is a TARGET not a TOOL. Strategic pivot: extract from BASE, treat fine-tune as noise.
  → `explore/compiler-finetune-halt-collapse.md`
- **s255** model-as-REPL (LLM as δ, context as machine state): locally-faithful step; shallow step-loop win,
  deep collapse; oracle-in-the-loop concluded (→ s259 clj-repl).
- **s254** repo distillation DESIGN-FIRST pivot (probes/*.json, results/<run_id> canonical forms in AGENTS.md);
  ornith-35B-A3B = lambda compiler over HTTP, 3rd model class (unconditional, present).
- **s253** vibethinker-3B new model; **s252** attention-edge knockout (s250 catch); **s251** frozen-basis
  gradient tomography → mature-14B, Gemma + Qwen3.6-35B in the crystal sweep; **s250** causal C-field ablation
  → object-application is DISTRIBUTED (no single-component locus; trending NO on discrete-circuit for object-app).
