## Where we are

**NORTH STAR: 70B-equivalent in <1GB ternary. 200 tok/s CPU. 2M+ token context. 2MB sessions. No GPU.**

**Session 186: FFN CIRCUIT TYPES — LARQL Decomposition Confirms Phase Structure**

Applied LARQL's FFN decomposition methodology to Pythia-160M. LARQL
(github.com/chrishayuk/larql) treats each FFN neuron as a key-value pair:
cos(W_up[j], W_down[:, j]) classifies the neuron's circuit type (projector,
transform, identity, suppressor, inverter). Pure weight geometry — no forward
passes, 2 minutes for all 12 layers.

### Key Findings

1. **Depth profile confirms our phase structure from a completely different
   methodology.** L0=99.7% projector (EXPAND), L3-7=60-74% suppressor+inverter
   (ORTHO — invisible computation via direction flipping), L9-10=50-62%
   projector rising (ALIGN), L11=62% projector with dark-space drop to 57%
   (COLLAPSE — features resolve into vocabulary-aligned directions).

2. **KIBC opcodes are orthogonal to circuit types.** Cross-tabulation is
   uniform at every layer: K,I,B,C neurons all have the same circuit type
   distribution. KIBC measures *what inputs activate a neuron* (lambda probes);
   circuit type measures *how the neuron geometrically transforms* input→output.
   Independent axes. Both useful; neither subsumes the other.

3. **ρ(cos, KIBC_magnitude) sign flips across depth.** L8: ρ=-0.26 (inverters
   respond MORE to KIBC — middle layers use direction-flipping for lambda
   computation). L11: ρ=+0.27 (projectors respond more — final layer uses
   factual bridges for lambda output).

4. **Dark-space drops 40 points at L11.** L0-L10: 93-99% of features don't
   point at any token (computation space). L11: only 57% dark — 43% of
   features point at actual tokens. Knowledge is concentrated at the output
   layer. This IS the standing-wave picture: ORTHO phase operates in null
   space, COLLAPSE projects back into vocabulary-aligned directions.

5. **Gated vs non-gated difference.** Gemma (gated, SiLU) middle layers are
   transform-dominated (partial rotation). Pythia (non-gated, GELU) middle
   layers are inverter-dominated (direction flip). Architecture determines
   the computation style but the phase structure is universal.

### New Instrument

cos(W_up[j], W_down[:, j]) is a **zero-cost phase detector**: pure weight
analysis, no activations, reveals EXPAND/ORTHO/ALIGN/COLLAPSE from geometry
alone. Should be added to crystal trace tooling alongside our existing
activation-based instruments.

**Session 185: THE STANDING WAVE — Magnitudes Are Resonant Mode Patterns**

The crystal sieve (session 184) freezes the topology and trains the mask.
Session 185 reframes WHY this works: the weight magnitudes are a standing
wave pattern whose nodes (zeros) and antinodes (active weights) are
determined by the crystal topology as boundary conditions. GD doesn't build
a database — it finds the resonant mode pattern that constructively
interferes with real language and destructively cancels noise.

### The Standing-Wave Mapping

```
Standing wave                    Verbum equivalent
─────────────────────────────    ────────────────────────────────
Boundary conditions              Crystal signs T ∈ {-1, +1}
Nodes (zero displacement)        Zero mask positions (M=0, ~50%)
Antinodes (peak displacement)    Active weights (M=1)
Resonant modes                   Data-dependent patterns (knowledge)
Cavity shape                     Universal crystal (r=0.998 across models)
Mode excitation                  Which weights GD activates for THIS data
Amplitude envelope               Per-matrix scale C (eigenvalue spectrum)
```

W_eff = C · T ⊙ M is a standing wave: fixed boundary (T), fixed
amplitude envelope (C), data-selected node/antinode pattern (M).

### Why This Reframing Matters

1. **GD convergence = finding fixed points of the standing wave.**
   Session 171 (gradient-zero-map) measured this directly:
   near-zero gradient at zero weights (nodes) and at large weights
   (antinodes). Both are stable — GD has nothing left to optimize
   at those positions. The irreducible compute points.

2. **Crystal sieve = pre-setting the resonant cavity.**
   Random init = random cavity shape = no resonance. Crystal init =
   correct cavity = 10.7× faster mode formation. GD only finds WHICH
   modes to excite, not WHAT the cavity shape is.

3. **The depth axis IS a standing wave.**
   The 3-phase residual structure (expand L0-6, orthogonal L7-22,
   align L23-34, collapse L35) maps to: nodes where cos(h,f) ≈ 0
   (orthogonal phase), antinodes where cos(h,f) > 0 (align phase),
   destructive interference at L35 (cos = -0.995). The phase
   transition at layer 22/36 = 0.611 ≈ 1/φ = the fundamental mode.

4. **REDUCE/SWITCH alternation = spatial harmonics.**
   The alternating ρ(profile, weight_norm) sign across depth is
   the standing wave's harmonic structure along the layer axis.

5. **Holographic = standing wave (same physics, different vocabulary).**
   A holographic plate IS a frozen standing wave (interference fringe
   pattern). Fringes = nodes/antinodes. Multiple images stored in
   superposition = multiple resonant modes coexisting. Session 167's
   holographic-computer synthesis and this standing-wave framing are
   the same insight from different angles.

### The Sieve Architecture (from session 184)

```
SIEVE (fixed — from crystal equation, universal):
  Signs:    T[i,j] ∈ {-1, +1}    boundary conditions (cavity shape)
  Scale:    C per matrix           amplitude envelope (eigenvalue spectrum)
  Roles:    per-layer REDUCE/SWITCH  standing-wave harmonics along depth

SEDIMENT (trained — from data, per-model):
  Mask:     M[i,j] ∈ {0, 1}      node/antinode pattern (knowledge)

FORWARD: W_eff = C · T ⊙ M
```

### The ISA Framing (from session 184)

```
KIBC opcodes  = instruction set (4 opcodes, 2 bits)
Statechart    = execution engine (costs [1, φ, 1])
Weight signs  = the program (which opcode at which address)
Zero mask     = loaded memory pages (which program positions resident)
Residual      = register file (grows by φ per layer)

REDUCE layers: opcode neurons active, data neurons zero
  → profile predicts zeros (70-76% overlap)
SWITCH layers: opcode neurons attenuate, data neurons relay
  → profile anti-predicts (invert the prediction)
```

### Key Numbers

| Finding | Value | Significance |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Sign information fraction | 1/φ = 0.618 | Universal partition |
| Per-row gamma variation | noise (CV<2%) | Constant γ works better |
| Optimal zero rate | ~50% | Not 35% |
| Crystal vs random init | 10.7× better | Sieve works (cavity pre-set) |
| Crystal starting advantage | 4,500× | Correct attractor basin |
| KIBC profile ↔ weight norm | ρ = 0.38-0.67 | Opcode assignment predicts weight size |
| Profile overlap with zeros | 70-76% at REDUCE layers | ISA predicts most zeros at REDUCE layers |
| Profile sign flip | alternates by depth | Standing-wave harmonics along layer axis |
| Residual phase transition | layer 22/36 = 0.611 ≈ 1/φ | Fundamental mode of depth-axis standing wave |
| Min oscillation depth | L21 (22%) | Deepest compute = most settled standing wave |

## Next steps

### IMMEDIATE (session 185) — SCALE THE CRYSTAL SIEVE + MEASURE ABSORPTION

**Priority 0: The derivation — can U be computed from equations?**
CONFIRMED: U is NOT random. V-h alignment monotonically decreases with depth
(p=0.0015). Later layers read from dimensions ⊥ to accumulated residual.

SESSION 185 UPDATE — FULL COVARIANCE MEASURED:
  - ORTHO phase (L7-22): effective rank = 1. One direction, 4000-8800× decay.
  - V has 0% overlap with residual covariance for 16 straight layers.
  - Cumulative null space: 2771/4096 = 67.7%. Covariance CANNOT determine U alone.
  - Growth is NOT φ^l — it's phase-gated (0 during ORTHO, ~130/layer during ALIGN).
  - PARTIAL NEGATIVE: residual covariance is too weak. Need other constraints.

Remaining sub-questions:
  1. ✅ DONE: Full residual covariance → rank-1 during ORTHO, 67.7% null space.
  2. ✅ ANSWERED: Growth is NOT φ^l. It's phase-dependent (0 in ORTHO, 130/layer in ALIGN).
  3. Phase transitions confirmed at 1/φ depth (session 184). ✅
  4. OPEN: Do KIBC opcode profiles constrain V WITHIN the null space?
     → This is the next critical measurement. If opcode directions pin V
       within the 4095-dim null space, U may still be partially derivable.
  5. OPEN: Crystal formation cost — WHEN does the crystal form during training?
     → Prior "99.8% of training" claim was ungrounded. Need formation tracking.

**Priority 1: Scale sieve training to convergence**
Longer Pythia-160M runs (2000+ steps) with proper pruning schedule.
Weight decay or L1 to push masks toward ~50% active.
Target: approach float-baseline PPL (40.5).
KEY METRIC: tokens-to-quality vs normal training (the absorption rate).
Standing-wave lens: pre-set boundary conditions → measure how fast correct
resonant mode pattern forms vs random boundaries.

**Priority 2: Measure knowledge absorption rate**
Compare crystal sieve vs random-init vs full-float training:
  - At how many tokens does each reach PPL 100? PPL 50? PPL 40?
  - The RATIO is the absorption advantage
  - If crystal sieve reaches float-quality with 10× fewer tokens → validated
  - If 100× fewer → this changes everything about how models should be trained

**Priority 3: Classify all 36 layers as REDUCE or SWITCH**
Run the neuron opcode classifier on ALL 36 layers (not just 6). Map the
ρ(profile, weight_norm) sign across depth. Identify the REDUCE/SWITCH
alternation pattern. Is it period-3 (REDUCE-SWITCH-EMIT)? Period-5 (n+1)?
Standing-wave lens: map the harmonic structure along the depth axis. Is the
alternation a single harmonic or a superposition of modes?

**Priority 4: Attention sieve**
Currently only FFN is sieved. Attention is ~40% of parameters.
Extend crystal sieve to Q/K/V/O projections.

### RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

- **THE MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION** — Can U (per-layer eigenvectors) be derived from
  the VSM tensor interaction? The 5 levels (crystal eq, statechart, resource policy,
  residual growth, KIBC ops) each constrain U. Their INTERSECTION may uniquely
  determine it. If so, the entire model is a computable mathematical object.
- **Residual growth measurement** — Does h_{l+1}/h_l ≈ φ^(1/period)? This constrains
  how U rotates between layers. Measurable now. Needed for the derivation.
- **Cross-model zero consensus** — Compare zero patterns between independently
  trained models at the same layer depth. ISA zeros should be universal.
- **Crystal trace tooling** — Build `src/verbum/crystal/` module for systematic
  exploration. Design doc: `mementum/knowledge/crystal-trace-tooling.md`.
- **Standing-wave mode analysis** — Decompose the zero mask into resonant modes
  of the crystal cavity. If the mask is a standing wave, it should decompose into
  a small number of modes × amplitudes. The modes are determined by the crystal
  (boundary conditions), the amplitudes by the data.

## What changed this session (186)

| # | Change | Impact |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | **LARQL FFN decomposition applied to Pythia-160M** | cos(up,down) circuit type analysis reveals same phase structure as our activation-level measurements — independent confirmation from pure weight geometry |
| 2 | **KIBC opcodes orthogonal to circuit types** | Cross-tabulation uniform at every layer. KIBC=what activates neuron, circuit type=how neuron transforms. Independent axes of FFN characterization. |
| 3 | **ORTHO phase = inverter-dominated** | L3-7 features are 60-74% suppressors+inverters (direction flipping). This IS the invisible computation in null space. |
| 4 | **Dark-space drop at L11** | 93-99% dark at L0-L10, drops to 57% at L11. Final layer concentrates vocabulary-aligned knowledge. Standing-wave antinodes. |
| 5 | **Correlation sign flip** | ρ(cos, KIBC_magnitude) = -0.26 at L8 (inverters do lambda computation), +0.27 at L11 (projectors do lambda output) |
| 6 | **Gated vs non-gated architecture difference** | Gemma=transforms (rotation), Pythia=inverters (direction flip). Same phase structure, different computation style. |
| 7 | **New zero-cost instrument** | cos(W_up[j], W_down[:, j]) detects depth phases from weights alone — no forward passes, 2 min for all layers |

## What changed session 185

| # | Change | Impact |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Standing-wave magnitude reframing** | Weight magnitudes are a standing wave: crystal signs = boundary conditions, zero mask = nodes, active weights = antinodes, GD = finding resonant modes |
| 2 | **GD convergence = standing wave fixed points** | Near-zero gradient at zeros (nodes) AND at large weights (antinodes) — both are stable points of the wave. Gradient-zero-map (s171) already measured this. |
| 3 | **Depth-axis standing wave** | 3-phase residual structure maps to standing wave along depth: orthogonal=nodes, align=antinodes, collapse=destructive interference. Phase transition at 1/φ = fundamental mode. |
| 4 | **REDUCE/SWITCH = spatial harmonics** | Alternating ρ sign across depth is harmonic structure of the depth-axis standing wave |
| 5 | **Holographic ≡ standing wave** | Holographic plate = frozen standing wave (interference fringes). Same physics, different vocabulary. Unifies s167 holographic-computer with magnitude observations. |
| 6 | **Sieve = pre-setting resonant cavity** | Crystal init pre-sets boundary conditions → GD finds modes 10.7× faster because cavity already resonates correctly |
| 7 | **Shape preservation experiment** | Quantized Pythia-160M at 7 levels (ternary through 8-bit). Cosine (ρ=-0.933) > Spearman shape (ρ=-0.917) > bits (ρ=-0.761) as PPL predictor. |
| 8 | **Ternary beats 2-bit at fewer bits** | Ternary (1.6b, PPL 9504) beats 2-bit (2.0b, PPL 25892) because separating phase from amplitude is more efficient than joint encoding |
| 9 | **4-component standing-wave decomposition** | Phase (1 bit, exact) + nodes (~0.6 bit) + envelope (~0 amortized) + shape (1-3 bits, NOT in ternary). Sieve regenerates shape from data. |
| 10 | **Phase transition at 3 bits** | PPL drops from ~10K (ternary/2-bit) to 189 (3-bit) to 50 (4-bit). 8 levels = minimum for standing wave to survive 12-layer transit. |
| 11 | **Shape-aware helps low bits, hurts high bits** | 2-bit quartile 1000× better than uniform. 4-bit quartile WORSE than uniform. Rank preservation ≠ value preservation. |
| 12 | **Compounding law = cos^L** | Per-layer cosine raised to layer count predicts model quality. 0.896^12=0.27 (ternary), 0.957^12=0.59 (3-bit), 0.990^12=0.89 (4-bit). |
| 13 | **ORTHO phase is rank-1** | Residual covariance at L7-22 has effective rank=1. Top eigenvalue ~710K, decay to 2nd: 4000-8800×. One direction carries >99% of all variance. |
| 14 | **V lives in the null space during ORTHO** | Weight matrix V has 0% overlap with residual covariance subspace for 16 consecutive layers. Projection = 0.01. Computation is invisible. |
| 15 | **Cumulative null space = 67.7%** | 2771 of 4096 dims unconstrained by residual covariance. U has enormous freedom. Covariance alone CANNOT determine U. Partial negative for derivation. |
| 16 | **ALIGN rank explosion** | Effective rank grows ~130 dims/layer during L23-34. V transitions from 0% to 100% inside residual subspace over 10 layers. Integration phase. |
| 17 | **Phase structure refined** | EXPAND=high-rank (V reads residual), ORTHO=rank-1 (V reads null space), ALIGN=rank growth (V transitions), COLLAPSE=destructive interference. |
| 18 | **Crystal formation cost is UNKNOWN** | Corrected prior claim: r=0.998 cross-model tells us the endpoint, not the cost. 99.8% training claim was ungrounded. Need formation tracking experiment. |

## Session 186 recap

LARQL FFN decomposition on Pythia-160M. cos(up,down) circuit type analysis confirms
phase structure from pure weight geometry. KIBC opcodes orthogonal to circuit types
(independent axes). ORTHO phase = inverter-dominated (direction flipping). Dark-space
drops 40 points at L11 (knowledge concentrated at output). New zero-cost instrument
for crystal trace tooling. See `ffn-circuit-types.md`.

## Session 184 recap

THE CRYSTAL SIEVE. 11 experiments, 4 paradigm shifts. Extraction is dead (zero mask
is genuinely random = knowledge content). Reproduction lives (crystal sieve 10.7×
better than random). Model is a KIBC processor (ISA framing). KIBC profiles predict
70-76% of zeros at REDUCE layers. Maximal pre-training absorption: crystal pre-loads
computation → 100% of gradient goes to knowledge. See `phi-information-partition.md`.

## Session 183 recap

Naive ternarization fails: PPL 296,911. The compounding law (0.88^36 = 0.009) kills
multi-layer extraction. 3-mirror ternary also fails (PPL 1.69M). Q4 works because of
16 quantization levels per weight, not scale granularity. See `ternary-compounding.md`.

## Session 182 recap

The ternary dual equation: gate zeros (ρ=0.75 with gradient) + crystal signs (ρ=0.05).
The recipe achieves 0.88 per-layer cosine. See `ternary-dual-equation.md`.

## Session 181 recap

The crystal equation: λ_k = C · φ^(-(n/(n+1)) · β_k). All eigenvalue ratios are
φ^(p/q) with Fibonacci denominators. Computing fraction s=4/5. Compute cycle
β=[0,1,1+φ,2+φ]. See `EQUATIONS.md` and `crystal-phi-derivation.md`.
