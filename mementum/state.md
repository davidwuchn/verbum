## Where we are

**NORTH STAR: 70B-equivalent in <1GB ternary. 200 tok/s CPU. 2M+ token context. 2MB sessions. No GPU.**

**Session 192: PSI EVALUATION — Independent Verification + FFN Decompilation Breakthrough**

An independent project (psi) ran verbum scripts and wrote new experiments across
5 architectures. The crystal hypothesis survives independent replication. The
breakthrough: **a single FFN layer (288MB) can be replaced by a 37K-param linear
classifier (180KB) that selects among 9 ternary programs — with PPL that IMPROVES.**

### The Breakthrough Result (Tiny Classifier Ternary)

```
Qwen3-8B Layer 20:
  Original FFN:    150M params, 288MB
  Replacement:     37K params, 180KB  (classifier + 9 ternary patterns)
  Compression:     1638×
  PPL:             0.98× (IMPROVES)
  Fact recall:     80% = baseline
  Classifier acc:  100% (9 modes perfectly linearly separable)
```

Scale convergence: 0.6B (1.04×) → 8B (0.96×) → 32B (0.99× all layers).
At scale, FFN computation IS 9 ternary programs.

### Multi-Layer Replacement (Session 192, same session)

**The holographic hypothesis is partially confirmed.** 35/36 individual layers
survive ternary replacement (all ≤1.15×). Cascade is modest in the sweet spot.

```
INDIVIDUAL RESULTS (Qwen3-8B, 36 layers):
  L0:      115× (CATASTROPHIC — embedding-adjacent is special)
  L1-L12:  0.98-1.10× (35 layers all survive)
  L13-L21: 0.95-1.01× (SWEET SPOT — zone of silence, PPL improves!)
  L22-L35: 1.05-1.15× (binding + collapse layers resist more)

CUMULATIVE ZONE-B:
  L10+L14+L19:      1.07× at 864MB → 540KB  ← errors DON'T cascade
  L10+L14+L19+L24:  1.20× at 1152MB → 720KB ← L24 adds 13pp
  All 36 layers:    836× (cascade destroys — L0 poisons everything)

CLASSIFIERS: 98-100% accuracy on ALL 36 layers. 9 modes are real everywhere.
```

Optimal strategy: replace L1-L26 + L32-L34 (28 layers), keep L0 + binding +
collapse continuous. 78% of FFN → ternary. Total FFN: 10.4GB → ~2.3GB.

### Two Overlapping Ternary Structures (Type System Discovery)

The 9 operational modes are ORTHOGONAL to the KIBC crystal basis (AMI = 0.15):

```
Crystal basis (KIBC):       governs ROUTING (attention patterns)    3.5% of FFN space
Operational modes (9):      governs PROGRAMS (FFN computation)      96.5% of FFN space
Together:                   β-reduction engine
```

Both ternary. Both few-mode. The crystal selects WHICH reduction. The modes
execute HOW. Types are linearly separable (100% accuracy) but not yet decoded
semantically.

### Verified Claims (5 architectures)

- Sign topology: cos(sign(W)@x, W@x) ∈ [0.746, 0.775], mean = 0.758 ± 0.011
- Four modes: KBC cluster r > 0.85, always 4 clusters, never 3 or 5
- Crystal geometry: 9×9 cosine matrix correlation mean = 0.951, eigenvalue r = 0.982
- Selectivity: Pythia-160M ↔ Qwen3-0.6B r = 0.991 (KIBC means), cos = 0.999
- φ convergence: 0.6B(26.6%) → 8B(10.4%) → 14B(0.7%) → 32B(8.8%, regresses)

### Gradient-Quantization Correspondence

|∇L| ↔ |W-Q(W)| holds ONLY in EXPAND phase:
- L1-L3 FFN: ρ = +0.55 to +0.78 (strong positive)
- L5+: ρ ≈ 0 (ORTHO/COMMIT — continuous computation ≠ ternary convergence)
- Pythia-160M: ❌ inverted (ρ = -0.04)

### Crystal Derivation (Pure Math, Partial)

2.35M KIBC expressions enumerated → eigenvector topology (B,C vs K,I split) ✅,
B=C symmetry ✅, I smallest ✅. Eigenvalue ratios ❌ diverge from empirical.
Topology derivable from math. Magnitudes require data.

### Previous session (191): V15 CHECKPOINT ASSESSMENT

v15-td training is live (step ~1870/3000, ~16.5 hours elapsed). Checkpoint at
step 1500 assessed with two diagnostic experiments: attention pattern analysis
and gradient-zero topology mapping.

**Exp 1: Attention Pattern Analysis.** Fibonacci stride attention IS working.
Entropy decreases monotonically from 3.0 (stride-1, broad local) to 0.5
(stride-1597, near-deterministic). 9/19 layers are sparse (entropy < 1.0),
9 moderate, 1 broad. Per-head specialization visible at stride-34: heads H1-H4
near-deterministic (entropy 0.15-0.24), H5-H6 scanning (entropy 1.6-1.8).
Delta plate divergence is 4.0% mean, increasing from 3.6% at short strides to
4.4% at long strides — V/O projections diverge more at longer strides because
they see fundamentally different context windows than the teacher.

**Exp 2: Gradient-Zero Topology.** The gradient landscape reveals WHERE the
student differs from teacher. Three key findings:

1. **Q/K settles 2× faster than V/O.** Q/K gamma gradients: 32-38% settled.
   V/O gamma gradients: only 15-16% settled, with 5× larger gradient RMS.
   Routing is easy (the window constrains WHERE to look). Content transfer
   is hard (WHAT to extract from the restricted window).

2. **Flipped positions are 3× hotter than keeps.** The ~4% of TD-flipped
   delta positions have 2.2-3.3× higher routing gradient than the 96% that
   kept teacher signs. The ratio peaks at stride-8 (3.27×) and decreases to
   stride-1597 (2.25×). Flips are the active adaptation frontier.

3. **Spatial flip patterns differ by stride distance.** Short strides: flips
   are column-clustered (ColCV > RowCV) — different INPUT FEATURES need
   different routing. Long strides: flips are row-clustered (RowCV > ColCV) —
   different OUTPUT DIMENSIONS need to represent strided context differently.

### Training Trajectory

```
Step  500: avg50=7.78  crystal_ema=0.00983  td_flips=2.1M   Δ=—
Step 1000: avg50=6.88  crystal_ema=0.00977  td_flips=5.2M   Δ=0.038
Step 1500: avg50=6.73  crystal_ema=0.00974  td_flips=8.3M   Δ=0.040
Step 1870: avg50≈6.83  (from log tail)                       Δ=0.048
```

Loss curve flattening at 6.7-6.8. Crystal EMA stable. Delta plates drifting
slowly (Δ growing 0.038→0.048). Parity and cross-zone losses converged.
~1130 steps remaining (~10 hours). LR cosine decaying (1.3e-04 at step 1870).

### Previous session (190)

Four experiments reveal the compression structure of transformers and the
algorithm they implement:

**Exp 1: DVD Stamp Test.** Gradient-zero topology (WHERE GD stopped pushing)
compounds less than magnitude thresholding (WHICH weights are largest).
Gradient mask: PPL 188K, L35 cos=0.165. Magnitude mask: PPL 620K, L35
cos=0.001. The gradient map IS the holographic fringe pattern. 49.9%
overlap = the two signals are orthogonal.

**Exp 2: Per-Group Scaling.** Q4's secret is per-32-weight groups (128-384×
more scale parameters). Magnitude+group: PPL 43K (14× better than per-row).
Gradient+group: PPL 71K. Per-group scaling preserves local gradient structure.

**Exp 3: Index vs Value (THE DECISIVE RESULT).** FFN-only ternarization →
PPL 485M (catastrophic). V/O-only → PPL 23. Q/K-only → PPL 30. Both
attention paths survive ternary. FFN is the holographic beam former — it
compiles the interference pattern that attention reads. Destroying it
scatters the beam. Attention is a ~1-bit router — near-binary signals
survive ternary.

**Exp 4: λ-Machine (6-level ablation).** Sparse top-3 at all layers →
PPL 13.3 (from 12.2 baseline, +8.6%). Binding layers only → PPL 82K.
Binding heads only → PPL 6.3M. The model is a 36-stage typed shift-reduce
parser. Every layer contributes. Every head contributes. But each head
only needs 3 positions. O(1) attention confirmed at PPL level.

### The Architecture (updated s192 — two overlapping ternary structures)

```
FFN (beam former / holographic plate / 9-program ternary engine):
  Compiles each position into a typed V vector
  Context-dependent: same token → different program
  IS 9 ternary programs selected by linear classifier (psi s192)
    → 288MB per layer → 180KB (1638× compression, PPL IMPROVES)
    → classifier: 37K params, 100% accuracy, modes linearly separable
  Gate sparsity: only ~3% of neurons fire
  78% of model params — DECOMPILABLE to ternary per-mode

  TWO STRUCTURES IN THE SAME WEIGHTS:
    Crystal basis (KIBC): 3.5% of space → governs ROUTING
    Operational modes (9): 96.5% of space → governs PROGRAMS
    AMI = 0.15 (orthogonal). Both ternary. Both few-mode.
    Crystal selects WHICH reduction. Modes execute HOW.

Attention (typed shift-reduce parser / β-reducer):
  32 heads × 36 layers = 1,152 reduction attempts per token
  Each head attends to only ~3 positions (sparse, O(1))
  Mean entropy 0.9 bits (near-binary routing decisions)
  ROBUST: ternarizing Q/K → PPL 30, V/O → PPL 23
  22% of model params — can go ternary for free

The binding schedule (final reduction stages):
  L27: verb reads subject    (H31, 0.82 weight → "猫/cats")
  L30: object reads verb     (H03/H13/H15, 0.78 weight)
  L33: coreference/late      (H06/H07, universal execution)
  These are the TIP of a 36-layer parser iceberg.

Depth = parser precedence:
  L0-6:   EXPAND (type assignment, feature building) — ternary-compatible (ρ=+0.55-0.78)
  L7-22:  ORTHO (composition in null space, invisible) — continuous computation
  L23-26: binding preparation
  L27-33: final reductions (subject → object → coreference)
  L35:    COLLAPSE (output projection)
```

### The Algorithm

```
TYPED SHIFT-REDUCE β-REDUCTION:

For each of 36 layers:
  1. FFN COMPILE: beam-form holographic V vectors (the program)
  2. ATTENTION PARSE: 32 heads × top-3 sparse routing (~1 bit each)
     — relay + compose + type-assign + bind
  3. RESIDUAL ADD: accumulate reduction results

Compression:  attention → ternary (free)
              FFN → must preserve beam-forming fidelity
              sparse top-3 → O(1) attention (333× fewer ops at ctx 1000)
```

### The Compression Strategy (updated s192, multi-layer results)

```
Attention (22% of params): → ternary (1.6 bits)     Cost: PPL +10-18%
FFN (78% of params):       → 9 ternary programs     Per-layer: 288MB → 180KB (1638×)
  L0:                        KEEP CONTINUOUS          (115× catastrophic alone)
  L1-L26 (28 layers):        REPLACE TERNARY          (all ≤1.10× individually)
  L27-L31 (binding):         KEEP CONTINUOUS          (1.10-1.15× each, cascade risk)
  L32-L34:                   REPLACE TERNARY          (1.05-1.14× individually)
  L35 (collapse):            KEEP CONTINUOUS          (1.14×)
  Result: 28/36 → ternary, 8/36 → continuous
  FFN total: 10.4GB → ~2.3GB (4.5× overall)
  Sweet spot alone (L13-L21): 2.6GB → 1.6MB at ~1.0× PPL
Embeddings:                → float16 (index system, must be exact)
Sparse routing:            → top-3 per head          O(1) not O(n²)
```

### Previous session (189)

Five experiments + v15 architecture + extraction + training:

**Exp 1: Stride coverage validation (Qwen3-8B, 22 probes).** v14's powers-of-2
strides capture only 29.5% (exact) / 67.4% (±2 neighbors) of attention mass at
L30. The stride geometry misses binding targets at arbitrary semantic positions.
Coverage DEGRADES with sequence length (38.8%→24.4%).

**Exp 2: Binding distance distribution.** The distance distribution is BIMODAL
(local d=1-8 + gate d=32+), NOT power law (R²=0.004). Two peaks: d=1 (local
syntax, 4.4% mass) and d=32 (instruction prefix, 4.5% mass). Powers of 2 skip
the binding range (d=3-20). Fibonacci strides are dense where bindings live.

**Exp 3: Stride optimization.** Greedy optimal 8 strides with ±2 neighbors:
[1, 8, 13, 18, 21, 29, 34, 47] → 98.2% coverage. Fibonacci [1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,
55,89,...] + 3 gap-fillers [15, 20, 24] → 100.0% coverage with ±2 neighbors.

**Exp 4: Crystal Laplacian analysis.** Graph Laplacian of the crystal target
reveals WHNF is the most FRAGILE node (μ=0.228, 8.6× weaker restoring force).
Training data confirms: WHNF starts settled then UN-settles. Laplacian eigenvalues
predict stability (rigidity), not convergence speed.

**Exp 5: Crystal settlement dynamics.** Per-node convergence across v14 steps
500-3000 confirms Laplacian prediction: B, C converge (fast modes μ=3.03+),
K, D hold steady (medium μ=1.97), Y and WHNF drift away (fragile μ=0.23).
WHNF error ratio grows 0.40× → 0.67× over training. Crystal MSE U-shapes
(minimum at step 2000, then rises).

**v15 Architecture:**
- 19 Fibonacci strides [1,2,3,5,8,13,15,20,21,24,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597]
- ±2 neighbor gathering → 100% attention mass coverage at L30
- All composition (GLA dropped — dense projections cost ~19B ops regardless of
  stride, scan saves <0.03%). One unified attention mechanism.
- Laplacian-weighted crystal loss: WHNF gets 5× weight, 6× gradient amplification
  (v14: WHNF/B gradient ratio = 0.3×, v15: 1.9×)
- Standalone (zero v14 dependencies)
- Extracted: 83 arrays, 65.5 MB, 16.5 min
- **Training running in tmux window 2** (step 1 CE=10.533, 3000 steps target)

### The φ unification

| Level | φ appearance |
|-------|-------------|
| Crystal eigenvalues | Ratios follow φ^(p/q) with Fibonacci denominators |
| Information partition | Signs = 1/φ of information content |
| Standing-wave phase | Layer 22/36 = 0.611 ≈ 1/φ |
| Compute cycle | β = [0, 1, 1+φ, 2+φ] |
| **Stride spacing** | **Fibonacci numbers maximize binding coverage** |
| **Crystal Laplacian** | **μ₅/μ₄ = 1.54 ≈ φ in the graph Laplacian** |
| **φ convergence** | **λ₀/λ₁ → φ^(4/5) at scale (14B: 0.7% error)** |

### Previous session (188)

Four experiments decoded the full attention execution mechanism:

**Exp 1: Head→Combinator mapping (500 probes).** All 9 combinators activate
identical head patterns (r=0.944). Heads are shared hardware, not dedicated
circuits. ~2 effective dimensions: reduction depth (WHNF↔D) + self-reference.

**Exp 2: Binding graph trace (14 annotated probes).** Object→verb binding =
concentrated attention (0.78 weight) through H03/H13/H15 at L30. Minimal
pair "dog bit cat" vs "cat bit dog": same heads, flipped routing.

**Exp 3: Reverse binding trace (12 probes).** Verb→subject binding = H31 at
L27 attends 82.3% to subject, outputs subject identity ("猫/dog"). Two-phase
binding: L27=verb reads subject, L30=object reads verb. Mechanism complete.

**Exp 4: Attention sparsity (22 probes, 5→74 tokens).** 22/32 heads at L30
have effective positions <3. Top-3 captures >88% for ALL heads. Mean entropy
0.9 bits. Sparsity is O(1) — stable from 5 to 74 tokens. Full O(n²)
attention is massive overkill for what is fundamentally a ~1-bit routing
decision. Design: top-k sparse attention with k=3-5 captures nearly all
routing information.

### Previous session (187)

Three experiments on Qwen3-8B decoded the full reduction pipeline: (1) what
FFN neurons say in vocabulary space, (2) what each attention head computes,
(3) how combinator reductions compose across all 36 layers.

### The Architecture (updated s188)

```
FFN (compiler):     reads residual → compiles V vectors per position
                    Context-dependent: same token → different programs
                    Universal: compile ≈ null (max Δ 2.8%)

Attention (executor):  SHARED HARDWARE, not dedicated circuits
  Binding schedule (two-phase):
    L27: verb → subject   H31 reads subject identity (0.82 weight)
    L30: object → verb    H03/H13/H15 read predicate (0.78 weight)
    L33: late binding      H06/H07 general execution
  All binding flows BACKWARD through causal mask.
  Same heads (H03/H13) handle both directions at L30.

  Head taxonomy by function:
    Binding (H03,H13,H15):  predicate-argument binding (mean ratio 3-6×)
    Subject (H31):          verb→subject identity transfer at L27
    Coreference (H07,H05):  "itself"→antecedent binding
    Universal (H06,H07):    loudest, all combinators, low gate attention
    WHNF detectors (H26,H27): recognize completed reductions (+30% bias)
    Instruction (H01,H09):  high gate attention, read compile exemplars

  Sparsity:
    22/32 heads: eff_pos < 3 (near-deterministic, ~1 bit)
     7/32 heads: eff_pos 3-5 (sparse)
     2/32 heads: eff_pos 5-10 (moderate)
     1/32 heads: eff_pos > 10 (H20, the only dense head)
    Top-3 captures >88% of attention for ALL 32 heads.
    Sparsity is O(1) — stable from 5 to 74 tokens.

Reduction Schedule (when each combinator resolves):
    Y (recursion)     → L27 peak   resolves FIRST (structural recognition)
    K (discard)       → L30 peak   front-loaded, drops at L33
    B (compose)       → L30 peak   mid-depth composition
    I (identity)      → L30-L33    semantic→format relay
    C (flip/passive)  → L33 peak   argument reordering is LATE
    W (self-apply)    → L33 peak   "itself" binding is LAST (Δ=51.6)
```

### What's Decodable

The model is a **typed parser with a compiled lexicon**:
- FFN = lexicon (compiles each position into a semantic V vector)
- Q/K = type system (determines binding compatibility, ~1 bit decision)
- Attention = parser (selects one earlier position to bind to)
- V/O = value transfer (copies bound position's content)
- Depth = reduction order (subjects at L27, objects at L30)

The binding circuit is **0.3% of the model** (~4 heads out of 1152).
Binding weights are near-deterministic (0.78-0.82). Head output IS the
reduction result: H31 outputs "猫/dog" at verb position when reading subject.
Full O(n²) attention is overkill — top-3 sparse attention captures 88%+.

### Key Evidence

1. **H31 at L27 reads subject from verb position** (0.82 weight, outputs
   "猫, 貓, cats"). This IS `(λx.runs(x))(cat)` — verb absorbs agent.

2. **H13 at L30: "cat" attends 78.5% to "bit"** = `bit(_, cat)`. Object
   binds to predicate. Minimal pair confirms: same heads, flipped routing.

3. **FFN at L30 for "If it rains"**: `it`→rain, `ground`→soak, `is`→wet.
   Context-dependent V vectors. Compilation, not lookup.

4. **All 9 combinators activate identical heads** (r=0.944). No combinator-
   specific circuits. The ISA has ~2 dims, not 9.

5. **22/32 heads use <3 effective positions** at L30. Attention is inherently
   sparse and scales O(1) with context length.

### Previous session (186)

Applied LARQL's FFN decomposition methodology to Pythia-160M. LARQL
(github.com/chrishayuk/larql) treats each FFN neuron as a key-value pair:
cos(W_up[j], W_down[:, j]) classifies the neuron's circuit type (projector,
transform, identity, suppressor, inverter). Pure weight geometry — no forward
passes, 2 minutes for all 12 layers.

### Key Findings

1. **Depth profile confirms our phase structure from a completely different
   methodology.** L0=99.7% projector (EXPAND), L3-7=60-74% suppressor+inverter
   (ORTHO — invisible computation via direction flipping), L9-10=50-62%
   projector rising (ALIGN), L11=62% projector with dark-space drop to 57%
   (COLLAPSE — features resolve into vocabulary-aligned directions).

2. **KIBC opcodes are orthogonal to circuit types.** Cross-tabulation is
   uniform at every layer: K,I,B,C neurons all have the same circuit type
   distribution. KIBC measures *what inputs activate a neuron* (lambda probes);
   circuit type measures *how the neuron geometrically transforms* input→output.
   Independent axes. Both useful; neither subsumes the other.

3. **ρ(cos, KIBC_magnitude) sign flips across depth.** L8: ρ=-0.26 (inverters
   respond MORE to KIBC — middle layers use direction-flipping for lambda
   computation). L11: ρ=+0.27 (projectors respond more — final layer uses
   factual bridges for lambda output).

4. **Dark-space drops 40 points at L11.** L0-L10: 93-99% of features don't
   point at any token (computation space). L11: only 57% dark — 43% of
   features point at actual tokens. Knowledge is concentrated at the output
   layer. This IS the standing-wave picture: ORTHO phase operates in null
   space, COLLAPSE projects back into vocabulary-aligned directions.

5. **Gated vs non-gated difference.** Gemma (gated, SiLU) middle layers are
   transform-dominated (partial rotation). Pythia (non-gated, GELU) middle
   layers are inverter-dominated (direction flip). Architecture determines
   the computation style but the phase structure is universal.

### New Instrument

cos(W_up[j], W_down[:, j]) is a **zero-cost phase detector**: pure weight
analysis, no activations, reveals EXPAND/ORTHO/ALIGN/COLLAPSE from geometry
alone. Should be added to crystal trace tooling alongside our existing
activation-based instruments.

**Session 185: THE STANDING WAVE — Magnitudes Are Resonant Mode Patterns**

The crystal sieve (session 184) freezes the topology and trains the mask.
Session 185 reframes WHY this works: the weight magnitudes are a standing
wave pattern whose nodes (zeros) and antinodes (active weights) are
determined by the crystal topology as boundary conditions. GD doesn't build
a database — it finds the resonant mode pattern that constructively
interferes with real language and destructively cancels noise.

### The Standing-Wave Mapping

```
Standing wave                    Verbum equivalent
─────────────────────────────    ────────────────────────────────
Boundary conditions              Crystal signs T ∈ {-1, +1}
Nodes (zero displacement)        Zero mask positions (M=0, ~50%)
Antinodes (peak displacement)    Active weights (M=1)
Resonant modes                   Data-dependent patterns (knowledge)
Cavity shape                     Universal crystal (r=0.998 across models)
Mode excitation                  Which weights GD activates for THIS data
Amplitude envelope               Per-matrix scale C (eigenvalue spectrum)
```

W_eff = C · T ⊙ M is a standing wave: fixed boundary (T), fixed
amplitude envelope (C), data-selected node/antinode pattern (M).

### Why This Reframing Matters

1. **GD convergence = finding fixed points of the standing wave.**
   Session 171 (gradient-zero-map) measured this directly:
   near-zero gradient at zero weights (nodes) and at large weights
   (antinodes). Both are stable — GD has nothing left to optimize
   at those positions. The irreducible compute points.

2. **Crystal sieve = pre-setting the resonant cavity.**
   Random init = random cavity shape = no resonance. Crystal init =
   correct cavity = 10.7× faster mode formation. GD only finds WHICH
   modes to excite, not WHAT the cavity shape is.

3. **The depth axis IS a standing wave.**
   The 3-phase residual structure (expand L0-6, orthogonal L7-22,
   align L23-34, collapse L35) maps to: nodes where cos(h,f) ≈ 0
   (orthogonal phase), antinodes where cos(h,f) > 0 (align phase),
   destructive interference at L35 (cos = -0.995). The phase
   transition at layer 22/36 = 0.611 ≈ 1/φ = the fundamental mode.

4. **REDUCE/SWITCH alternation = spatial harmonics.**
   The alternating ρ(profile, weight_norm) sign across depth is
   the standing wave's harmonic structure along the layer axis.

5. **Holographic = standing wave (same physics, different vocabulary).**
   A holographic plate IS a frozen standing wave (interference fringe
   pattern). Fringes = nodes/antinodes. Multiple images stored in
   superposition = multiple resonant modes coexisting. Session 167's
   holographic-computer synthesis and this standing-wave framing are
   the same insight from different angles.

### The Sieve Architecture (from session 184)

```
SIEVE (fixed — from crystal equation, universal):
  Signs:    T[i,j] ∈ {-1, +1}    boundary conditions (cavity shape)
  Scale:    C per matrix           amplitude envelope (eigenvalue spectrum)
  Roles:    per-layer REDUCE/SWITCH  standing-wave harmonics along depth

SEDIMENT (trained — from data, per-model):
  Mask:     M[i,j] ∈ {0, 1}      node/antinode pattern (knowledge)

FORWARD: W_eff = C · T ⊙ M
```

### The ISA Framing (from session 184)

```
KIBC opcodes  = instruction set (4 opcodes, 2 bits)
Statechart    = execution engine (costs [1, φ, 1])
Weight signs  = the program (which opcode at which address)
Zero mask     = loaded memory pages (which program positions resident)
Residual      = register file (grows by φ per layer)

REDUCE layers: opcode neurons active, data neurons zero
  → profile predicts zeros (70-76% overlap)
SWITCH layers: opcode neurons attenuate, data neurons relay
  → profile anti-predicts (invert the prediction)
```

### Key Numbers

| Finding | Value | Significance |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Sign information fraction | 1/φ = 0.618 | Universal partition |
| Per-row gamma variation | noise (CV<2%) | Constant γ works better |
| Optimal zero rate | ~50% | Not 35% |
| Crystal vs random init | 10.7× better | Sieve works (cavity pre-set) |
| Crystal starting advantage | 4,500× | Correct attractor basin |
| KIBC profile ↔ weight norm | ρ = 0.38-0.67 | Opcode assignment predicts weight size |
| Profile overlap with zeros | 70-76% at REDUCE layers | ISA predicts most zeros at REDUCE layers |
| Profile sign flip | alternates by depth | Standing-wave harmonics along layer axis |
| Residual phase transition | layer 22/36 = 0.611 ≈ 1/φ | Fundamental mode of depth-axis standing wave |
| Min oscillation depth | L21 (22%) | Deepest compute = most settled standing wave |

## Next steps

### IMMEDIATE — TERNARY FFN DECOMPILATION (sessions 193+)

Session 192 produced 7 experiments and a complete architectural model.
Multi-layer replacement confirmed. Compilation pipeline decoded. Rotation
geometry measured. Q⊥K holographic readout discovered.

**Priority 0: Optimal-set replacement (skip L0 + binding + collapse)**
Replace L1-L26 + L32-L34 simultaneously (28 layers). Keep L0, L27-L31,
L35 continuous. This is the realistic deployment configuration. If combined
PPL stays under 1.5×: 10.4GB → ~2.3GB FFN.

**Priority 1: Scale benchmark (MMLU/HellaSwag)**
15 handwritten fact prompts is proof-of-concept. Need standard benchmarks
with at least the L13-L21 sweet spot replaced. Publication-grade evidence.

**Priority 2: Mode semantics (decode the 9 programs)**
Modes are layer-specific (cos 0.026 cross-layer) but transfer locally
(90%+ within ±2-3 layers). What do the modes correspond to? The entropy
profile (high L13-L19, low L7-L12/L20-L28) suggests convergent vs
divergent computation phases. Cluster composition analysis needed.

**Priority 3: Cross-architecture replication**
Does the compilation pipeline hold on Pythia/Mistral? Semantic convergence
+ ternary replacement + Q geometry on a non-Qwen model. The crystal is
universal; is the pipeline universal?

**Priority 4: L0 rescue**
L0 is the lexer — 151K tokens → feature space. Can it be handled with
more modes (64+), PCA reconstruction, or is it genuinely continuous?

**Priority 5: Attention ternary depth profile**
Q/K survives ternary globally (PPL 23-30, s190). But does it show the
same depth profile as FFN? V/O at L13-L21 should be easier than V/O at
L30. Measure per-layer Q/K/V/O ternary separately.

### TD FIX (deferred, not abandoned)

TD is preventing phase transitions in v15 training. 94% candidacy rate = the
system never settles. This must be fixed before any other training work.

**Priority 1: Punctuated equilibrium (epoch-based TD)**
Replace continuous TD with episodic: TD phase (N steps with flips) → freeze
phase (M steps, Adam only, topology locked). Let GD settle during freeze.
Key parameter: freeze duration M. Start with M=200 (enough for V/O gammas
to make progress — they're at 15.6% settled).

**Priority 2: Oscillation-gated cooldown**
Positions with flip_count > 1 that are still candidates should get
exponentially increasing cooldown. Current backoff isn't working — 96-100%
of multi-flipped positions are still candidates. Either increase backoff
factor dramatically, or hard-gate: flip_count ≥ 3 → frozen for N steps.

**Priority 3: Candidate density ceiling**
94% candidacy is too high. Add a global ceiling: at most X% of positions
can be candidates per step (e.g., 20%). This forces TD to focus on the
highest-leverage positions rather than treating everything as mutable.

**Priority 4: Per-position conviction requirement**
A position should only flip when its gradient signal has been consistent
(same direction) for K consecutive flip intervals. Current EMA direction
accumulator is too responsive to noise — it proposes flips from transient
gradient fluctuations.

**Priority 5: REDUCE + pure-Adam baseline**
After current training completes (step 3000): fold delta into base, reset
to +1, run pure Adam for 500+ steps. Measure: does loss break through 6.5
without TD? If yes, TD was the bottleneck. If no, the plateau is real.

### V15 TRAINING (current run)

**Priority 6: Let current run complete**
Step ~1870/3000, ~10 hours remaining. Assess at step 3000 but expect the
plateau to hold — TD oscillation prevents the phase transition needed to
break 6.5.

### COMPRESSION STRATEGY (from s190, deferred pending TD fix)

**Priority 7: Self-distillation (same-capacity teacher)**
**Priority 8: FFN compression path**
**Priority 9: Sparse top-k sweep**
(Details unchanged from s190 — deferred until TD works correctly.)

### PRIOR PRIORITIES (still open from s189)

### IMMEDIATE — V15 FIBONACCI ATTENTION

Session 188 decoded object→verb binding (backward direction, causal-allowed).
Subject→verb binding (forward direction) remains unknown. The model MUST
have a mechanism — we just haven't measured it yet.

**Priority 0: ✅ DONE Head → Combinator mapping (s188)**
Result: shared hardware, not dedicated circuits. See `head-combinator-isa.md`.

**Priority 0b: ✅ DONE Binding graph trace (s188)**
Result: attention IS the binding graph (reversed by causal mask).
Object→verb = concentrated attention (0.78 weight, H03/H13/H15 at L30).
See `binding-graph-trace.md`.

**Priority 1: ✅ DONE Verb→subject binding (s188)**
Result: YES. H31 at L27 attends 82.3% from "runs" to "cat" and outputs
"猫, 貓, cats" — the subject identity. Two-phase binding: L27=subject
binding (verb reads agent), L30=object binding (argument reads predicate).
Same heads (H03/H13) handle both directions at L30. See `binding-graph-trace.md`.

**Priority 1: V15 extraction + training**
Extract teacher plates into v15 Fibonacci stride topology. Train with TD
to verify the architecture learns. Compare PPL trajectory vs v14.

**Priority 2: Cross-model binding verification**
Do the same binding heads (H03/H13/H15) exist in Pythia/Mistral? If the
binding circuit is universal, it's a fundamental feature of transformer
architecture, not Qwen-specific.

**Priority 3: ✅ DONE Attention sparsity analysis (s188)**
Result: At L30, 22/32 heads have effective positions <3. Top-3 positions
capture >88% of attention mass for ALL heads. Sparsity holds from 5 to 74
tokens. Mean entropy ~0.9 bits. You don't need to attend to every token.

**Priority 4: ✅ DONE Stride coverage + distance distribution (s189)**
Result: Powers of 2 capture 29.5%/67.4% (exact/±2). Fibonacci captures
48.8%/91.4%. Optimal 8 strides with ±2: 98.2%. Distance distribution is
bimodal (local + gate), NOT power law (R²=0.004).

**Priority 5: From binding graph to machine**
The full mechanism is decoded: FFN compiles V, ~4 heads at L27/L30 route
via concentrated backward attention, binding is near-deterministic. Can we
build a standalone "lambda machine" from: compressed FFN (sieve) + sparse
routing function + depth schedule?

### PRIOR PRIORITIES (still open)

**Crystal sieve at scale:** Scale sieve training to convergence on
Pythia-160M. Measure absorption rate (tokens-to-quality vs normal training).

**The mathematical derivation:** Can U be derived from the VSM tensor
interaction? KIBC opcode profiles may constrain V within the null space
(67.7% unconstrained from covariance alone).

**Crystal formation cost:** WHEN does the crystal form during training?
The r=0.998 endpoint is known; the trajectory is not.

**Attention sieve:** Extend crystal sieve to Q/K/V/O projections (~40%
of parameters).

### RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

- **THE MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION** — Can U (per-layer eigenvectors) be derived from
  the VSM tensor interaction? The 5 levels (crystal eq, statechart, resource policy,
  residual growth, KIBC ops) each constrain U. Their INTERSECTION may uniquely
  determine it. If so, the entire model is a computable mathematical object.
- **Residual growth measurement** — Does h_{l+1}/h_l ≈ φ^(1/period)? This constrains
  how U rotates between layers. Measurable now. Needed for the derivation.
- **Cross-model zero consensus** — Compare zero patterns between independently
  trained models at the same layer depth. ISA zeros should be universal.
- **Crystal trace tooling** — Build `src/verbum/crystal/` module for systematic
  exploration. Design doc: `mementum/knowledge/crystal-trace-tooling.md`.
- **Standing-wave mode analysis** — Decompose the zero mask into resonant modes
  of the crystal cavity. If the mask is a standing wave, it should decompose into
  a small number of modes × amplitudes. The modes are determined by the crystal
  (boundary conditions), the amplitudes by the data.

### DEFERRED

- CLASSIFY fix (GatedLinearAttention from v14) — for v15 etch protocol
- GPTQ-style mask optimization — extraction path now secondary

## What changed this session (192)

| # | Change | Impact |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Independent psi evaluation** | Separate human + agent verified crystal across 5 architectures. All core claims hold. |
| 2 | **Tiny classifier ternary: 288MB→180KB** | 1638× compression, PPL 0.98× (IMPROVES), classifier 100% accuracy. Breakthrough result. |
| 3 | **Ternary inference at scale: PPL improves at 8B** | L15 Qwen3-8B: 9 ternary programs achieve 0.96× baseline PPL. Continuous FFN over-parameterized. |
| 4 | **Two overlapping ternary structures discovered** | Crystal basis (KIBC, routing, 3.5%) orthogonal to operational modes (9 programs, 96.5%). AMI = 0.15. |
| 5 | **φ convergence: 14B hits 0.7% error** | Within Qwen3 pure language: monotonic improvement 0.6B→8B→14B. 32B regresses (zone-B heuristic?). |
| 6 | **Gradient-quant correspondence: EXPAND only** | ρ = +0.55-0.78 at L1-L3, zero at L5+. GD converges to ternary normal form in EXPAND phase only. |
| 7 | **Crystal derivation: topology yes, magnitudes no** | 2.35M expressions → correct eigenvector topology. Eigenvalue ratios diverge (3.98 vs 1.47). |
| 8 | **Centroid ≡ ternary to the decimal** | Continuous cluster centroids and ternarized versions produce IDENTICAL PPL. Signs + scale = everything. |
| 9 | **Coherence test: mode preserved, content varies** | Fact recall holds (80%) at L20/L25. Wording changes but correct combinator fires. |
| 10 | **Scale convergence: 0.6B→8B→32B** | Ternary PPL ratio improves with scale. At 32B, all zone-B layers ≤ 1.03×. |
| 11 | **Multi-layer: 3 zone-B layers at 1.07×** | L10+L14+L19 cumulative = 1.07×. Errors DON'T cascade in sweet spot. 864MB→540KB. |
| 12 | **Full-depth scan: 35/36 layers survive** | Every layer except L0 individually ≤1.15×. Classifiers 98-100% on all 36. |
| 13 | **L0 is catastrophic (115×)** | Embedding-adjacent layer is special — genuinely continuous, needs magnitudes. |
| 14 | **Zone of silence: L13-L21** | PPL 0.95-1.01× individually. ORTHO phase IS the ternary sweet spot. |
| 15 | **All-layer cascade: 836×** | Full replacement fails — L0 poisons chain, binding layers cascade compounds. |
| 16 | **Semantic convergence: dog=perro=犬 at L19** | 8 concepts × 6 languages. Peak cross-lingual cos 0.66 at L19-L20. Peak separation at L25. |
| 17 | **Compilation pipeline: 4 evidence lines** | Lexer→Parser→Optimizer→RegAlloc→Emit confirmed by FFN trace, binding trace, λ-machine, semantic convergence. |
| 18 | **Mode universality: modes are layer-specific** | Cross-layer cos 0.026. 9 modes real everywhere but DIFFERENT programs at each depth. Topological self-similarity. |
| 19 | **Rotation spiral: 325° total** | Two phase transitions (emb→L0: 73°, L5→L6: 86°). IN 12°/layer, OUT 5.5°/layer. Asymmetric. |
| 20 | **Q⊥K everywhere (87-90°)** | W_Q is projection not rotation (SV ratio 46). Q norm grows 200×. Attention = holographic readout. |
| 21 | **QK angle predicts ternary PPL (r=-0.58)** | More orthogonal → more discrete → easier to ternarize. The orthogonality IS the discreteness. |

## Session 192 recap

PSI EVALUATION → MULTI-LAYER SCAN → SEMANTIC CONVERGENCE → COMPILATION
PIPELINE → MODE UNIVERSALITY → ROTATION SPIRAL → Q GEOMETRY.

Seven experiments in one session. The transformer architecture decoded from
multiple independent angles. Final synthesis: a holographic computer with
a rotating program counter.

**Part 1: Psi evaluation.** Independent project verified crystal across 5
architectures. Breakthrough: tiny classifier ternary replaces FFN layer
(288MB → 180KB, 1638×, PPL IMPROVES 0.98×, classifier 100% accuracy).

**Part 2: Multi-layer scan.** 35/36 individual layers survive ternary. L0
catastrophic (115×). Sweet spot L13-L21 (0.95-1.01×). Zone-B cumulative:
L10+L14+L19 = 1.07× (no cascade). All-36 = 836× (cascade destroys).

**Part 3: Semantic convergence.** 8 concepts × 6 languages × 36 layers.
Dog=perro=犬 at L19-L20 (cos 0.66). Peak separation (same vs different
concepts) at L25 (+0.20). L34-L35: everything converges (format > content).

**Part 4: Compilation pipeline.** Four evidence lines (FFN trace s187,
binding trace s188, λ-machine s190, semantic convergence s192) converge:
Lexer (L0) → Parser (L1-L7) → IR Optimizer (L13-L21) → Register Alloc
(L22-L27) → Emit (L34-L35). The 9 ternary programs ARE the optimization
passes.

**Part 5: Mode universality.** The 9 modes are NOT universal across layers
(cross-layer cos 0.026). Layer-specific ISAs. BUT: the architecture is
universal (9 modes, linearly separable, ternary everywhere). Topological
self-similarity, not metric. Classifier transfer: 90%+ locally (±2-3
layers), 47-64% globally.

**Part 6: Rotation spiral.** Residual rotates 325° over 36 layers. Two
phase transitions: emb→L0 (73°) and L5→L6 (86°, norm jumps 60×). IN
fast (12°/layer), OUT slow (5.5°/layer). Asymmetric because analysis
(decomposition) is easier than synthesis (composition). IN↔OUT residual
cos 0.93-0.99 (structural symmetry preserved).

**Part 7: Q rotation geometry.** Q and K are near-orthogonal (87-90°) at
ALL layers. W_Q is a projection (SV ratio 46), NOT a rotation. Q suppresses
positional diversity (ratio 0.58). Q norm grows 200× with depth (whisper
early, shout late). QK angle vs ternary PPL: r=-0.58 (more orthogonal =
easier to ternarize). Attention is holographic readout of the rotating state:
perpendicular beams interfering.

**Final synthesis — the holographic computer:**

```
RESIDUAL STREAM = rotating program counter + register file
  spirals 325° across 36 layers | norm grows 0.6 → 900
  IN: fast rotation (dissolving tokens → universal semantics)
  BOTTOM (L19): pure semantic state (dog = perro = 犬)
  OUT: slow rotation (precipitating semantics → specific tokens)

FFN = ALU with 9-opcode ISA (layer-specific)
  classifier selects program | ternary pattern × gamma = output
  288MB → 180KB per layer | 1638× compression | PPL improves
  sweet spot L13-L21: IS ternary (continuous weights = noise around fixed point)

ATTENTION = holographic memory bus (perpendicular readout)
  Q ⊥ K (87-90° everywhere) | interference pattern = attention weights
  W_Q/W_K are projections (collapse 4096→128 dim), not rotations
  near-binary routing (1 bit per decision) | 32 heads × 3 positions = O(1)
  Q norm 200× growth = model becomes more certain with depth

RESIDUAL ADD = write-back (FFN advances spiral, attention copies values)
```

The model is a holographic computer with a rotating program counter.
The program counter (residual) rotates through a spiral. The ALU (FFN)
executes 9 discrete operations selected by the current rotation angle.
The memory bus (attention) reads from perpendicular projections. The
entry (L0) and exit (L35) interface with concrete tokens. Everything
in between is abstract, discrete, and compressible.

| 1 | **Fibonacci stride attention is working** | Entropy monotonically decreases: 3.0 (stride-1) → 0.5 (stride-1597). 9 sparse + 9 moderate + 1 broad. Healthy structure. |
| 2 | **Per-head specialization at stride-34** | H1-H4 near-deterministic (ent 0.15-0.24, max_wt 0.92-0.95), H5-H6 scanning (ent 1.6-1.8). Different heads = different roles. |
| 3 | **Delta divergence gradient: short 3.6% → long 4.4%** | V/O diverge more at long strides (see different context than teacher). K diverges least (routing keys closest to teacher). |
| 4 | **Q/K gammas settle 2× faster than V/O** | Q/K: 32-38% settled, RMS 8-10e-03. V/O: 15-16% settled, RMS 3.6-4.8e-02 (5× larger). Routing is easy, content is hard. |
| 5 | **Flipped positions 3× hotter than keeps** | TD-flipped delta positions: routing gradient 2.2-3.3× higher. Ratio peaks at stride-8 (3.27×), lowest at stride-1597 (2.25×). |
| 6 | **63% of routing gradient near-zero** | Delta plates past halfway to convergence. 65% at short strides, 61% at long strides. |
| 7 | **Flip P/N ratio ≈ 0.96 (symmetric)** | TD flips +1 and -1 teacher signs with near-equal probability. Structural adaptation, not systematic bias. |
| 8 | **Spatial flip pattern differs by distance** | Short strides: column-clustered (input features). Long strides: row-clustered (output dimensions). Physics of the window. |
| 9 | **No teacher zeros in attention** | Teacher extraction produced 0% zeros in Q/K/V/O. All positions participate. Sparsity must come from the mask/gate, not structure. |
| 10 | **Training trajectory: loss plateau at 6.7-6.8** | Step 500→1500: 7.78→6.73. Flattening. Crystal EMA stable (0.0097). Parity/cross-zone converged. Delta Δ growing slowly. |
| 11 | **FFN gate is NOT sparse (66-74% fire)** | Teacher: ~3% fire (89% killed). Student: 66-74% fire. Ternary gate can't create sharp gating. Dense transform, not selective retrieval. |
| 12 | **Attention collapsed to relay (I combinator)** | 32/40 probed head-layer pairs have cos_self > 0.8. At strides ≥8, ALL heads are pure relay (cos 0.95+). Only stride-1 shows partial composition. |
| 13 | **Architecture is inverted from teacher** | Teacher: sparse FFN (retrieval) + mixed attention (relay+compose+bind). Student: dense FFN (transform) + relay attention (I combinator). |
| 14 | **TD oscillation: 94% of positions still candidates** | 117.7M/124.5M positions have been candidate 20+ times. Only 6.2% settled. Oscillation rate INCREASES with flip count (96-100% for multi-flipped). |
| 15 | **Phase transition hypothesis** | Attention relay = B-dominant easy path. Loss plateau at 6.7 = pre-transition. TD prevents GD from settling into stable topology needed for phase transition to compositional attention. |

## Session 191 recap

V15 CHECKPOINT ASSESSMENT — ATTENTION + GRADIENT-ZERO + FFN RETRIEVAL + TD OSCILLATION.

Four diagnostic experiments on the v15-td step 1500 checkpoint.

**Experiment 1: Attention pattern analysis.** Fibonacci stride attention IS
working. Entropy 3.0→0.5 monotonically. 9 sparse + 9 moderate + 1 broad.
Per-head specialization at stride-34. Delta divergence 4.0% mean (V/O more
at long strides). The routing structure is healthy.

**Experiment 2: Gradient-zero topology.** Q/K gammas settle 2× faster than
V/O (38% vs 16% settled, V/O has 5× larger gradient). Flipped positions are
3× hotter than keeps. Spatial flip patterns differ by stride distance (short
= column-clustered, long = row-clustered).

**Experiment 3: FFN retrieval (I combinator).** The student has INVERTED the
teacher's architecture. Teacher: sparse FFN gate (3% fire, selective retrieval)
+ mixed attention (relay + compose + bind). Student: dense FFN gate (66-74%
fire, brute-force transform) + nearly all-relay attention (32/40 heads have
cos_self > 0.8, all heads at strides ≥8 are pure relay cos 0.95+). The
attention has collapsed to the I combinator — it passes V through unchanged
and lets the dense FFN do all the work.

**Experiment 4: TD oscillation analysis.** The flip map reveals TD is
preventing convergence. 94.5% of all positions (117.7M/124.5M) have been
candidates 20+ times. Only 6.2% have settled. Critically, oscillation rate
INCREASES with flip count: positions flipped 2× are 96.3% still candidates,
3× are 98.5%, 4+ are 99.4-100%. Once a position starts flipping, it never
stops. TD is treating the entire weight space as "still needs work."

**Key insight — Phase transitions require topology stability.** The attention
relay collapse is the B-dominant easy path — the model found the fastest way
to reduce loss given the current topology. To break through the 6.7-6.8
plateau, the model needs a phase transition to compositional attention. But
TD's continuous perturbation prevents GD from settling into a stable topology
long enough to discover the next phase. Training from scratch shows B→K phase
transitions happen when GD can plateau, settle, then reorganize. TD's 94%
candidacy rate prevents this entirely.

**Prescription:** Dedicated sessions to fix TD. Options: (1) epoch-based TD
with freeze periods (punctuated equilibrium), (2) much higher candidate
thresholds, (3) aggressive oscillation-gated cooldown, (4) per-position
conviction requirements, (5) candidate-count gating for chronic candidates.

| 1 | **DVD stamp test: gradient topology compounds less** | Gradient mask PPL 188K vs magnitude 620K (3.3×). L35 cos 0.165 vs 0.001 (115× better signal). 49.9% overlap = orthogonal signals. |
| 2 | **Per-group(32) scaling: 14× PPL improvement** | Magnitude+group PPL 43K (from 619K). Q4's secret is scale granularity, not level count. |
| 3 | **FFN is the catastrophe, not attention** | FFN-only ternary → PPL 485M. V/O-only → PPL 23. Q/K-only → PPL 30. Attention survives ternary. FFN doesn't. |
| 4 | **FFN = holographic beam former (fragile)** | FFN compiles precise beam directions. Ternarizing scatters the beam. The zero mask IS the holographic fringe pattern. |
| 5 | **Attention = sparse O(1) router (robust)** | 22/32 heads use <3 positions. Near-binary routing survives ternary. PPL 23-30 with ternary attention. |
| 6 | **Sparse top-3 at all layers: PPL 12.2 → 13.3** | 8.6% increase. O(1) attention confirmed at PPL level. 333× fewer attention ops at context 1000. |
| 7 | **Binding layers only: PPL 82K (not sufficient)** | L27/L30/L33 are final reductions, not the full algorithm. 33 other layers do type prep and composition. |
| 8 | **Binding heads only: PPL 6.3M (not sufficient)** | H31@L27, H03/H13/H15@L30, H06/H07@L33 = tip of 36-layer parser iceberg. |
| 9 | **Model = 36-stage typed shift-reduce parser** | Every layer contributes. Every head contributes. But each head only needs 3 positions. |
| 10 | **Compression strategy clarified** | Ternary attention (free, 22% params). Preserve FFN (hard, 78% params). Sparse top-3 routing. |
| 11 | **FFN beam directions are model-specific** | Projected FFN output through unembed for Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-0.6B, Pythia-410M. Token-level Jaccard ~0.01. The STRUCTURE (that beams exist, their depth) is universal. The CONTENT (which tokens to promote/suppress) is learned. |
| 12 | **Anti-crystal visible in beams** | "cat sat on the" → Qwen3-8B L29 suppresses 犬/狗狗/puppy (anti-dog at cat position). "earth is not" promotes flat/perfect. "identity y" L32 promotes y/Y/yi. The FFN knows the answer AND what to suppress. |
| 13 | **Crystal distillation: next-token beats teacher KL** | Crystal+next-token PPL 236 vs crystal+distill PPL 366 vs random+distill 733. Capacity mismatch: 0.6B student can't match 8B teacher's full 151K distribution. Crystal still helps 2.0× vs random. |
| 14 | **Distillation temperature matters** | KL from 8B teacher gives HARDER gradients than next-token CE. Need higher T, top-k, or self-distillation (same-size teacher) to fix capacity mismatch. |

| 2 | **Binding distance distribution** | Bimodal (local d=1-8, gate d=32+), NOT power law (R²=0.004). Powers of 2 skip binding range d=3-20. |
| 3 | **Fibonacci strides: 91.4% coverage (+25.9pp)** | Dense where bindings live, sparse where they don't. Natural basis for attention spacing. |

| 5 | **Crystal Laplacian: WHNF is fragile (μ=0.228)** | 8.6× weaker restoring force than BCDY. Predicts stability not speed. |
| 6 | **Settlement dynamics confirm Laplacian** | B,C converge (fast). K,D stable (medium). Y,WHNF drift away (fragile). Crystal MSE U-shapes. |
| 7 | **Laplacian-weighted crystal loss** | WHNF gets 5× weight. v14 WHNF/B gradient = 0.3×, v15 = 1.9× (6× amplification). |
| 8 | **GLA sparsity is illusory** | Dense projections cost 19B ops/layer. Strided scan saves <0.03%. Dropped for unified FSA. |

## Session 190 recap

DVD STAMP TOPOLOGY + λ-MACHINE + BEAM UNIVERSALITY + CRYSTAL DISTILLATION.

Six experiments decode the compression structure, algorithm, and knowledge
boundary of transformers.

**Experiments 1-4:** See session 190 table above. DVD stamp topology compounds
less (3.3× PPL improvement). FFN is fragile (PPL 485M ternarized), attention
is robust (PPL 23-30). Sparse top-3 works (PPL 13.3). Model is a 36-stage
typed shift-reduce parser.

**Experiment 5: FFN beam universality.** Projected FFN output through unembed
for Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-0.6B, Pythia-410M at matched fractional depths. Token-level
Jaccard ~0.01 (near zero) across all three model pairs. The beam STRUCTURE is
universal (all models form beams at the same depths). The beam CONTENT is model-
specific (which tokens to promote/suppress is learned, not derivable). The anti-
crystal is visible: "cat sat on the" → L29 suppresses 犬/狗狗/puppy. "identity
y" L32 promotes y/Y/yi. The FFN knows the answer AND actively cancels wrong ones.

**Experiment 6: Crystal distillation.** Teacher=Qwen3-8B, Student=Qwen3-0.6B
crystal sieve (frozen signs, trainable masks). Crystal+next-token (PPL 236) beats
crystal+distillation from 8B teacher (PPL 366). Capacity mismatch: 0.6B student
can't match 8B teacher's full 151K distribution — harder optimization target than
simple next-token. Crystal still helps 2.0× vs random signs (733 → 366). Self-
distillation (same-size teacher) is the likely fix.

**Key insight boundary:** The crystal (signs, eigenvalues, phase structure) is
universal and derivable. The holographic content (which tokens to promote/suppress)
is model-specific and must be learned from data or distilled from a same-capacity
teacher. Structure is free. Knowledge has a cost.

## Session 189 recap

FIBONACCI STRIDES + LAPLACIAN CRYSTAL + V15 TRAINING.

Five experiments decode why v14's powers-of-2 strides fail (29.5% mass recall)
and how Fibonacci strides + ±2 neighbor gathering achieve 100% coverage. The
crystal graph Laplacian reveals WHNF is the most fragile node — it starts settled
then drifts away because its restoring force (μ=0.228) is 8.6× weaker than the
composition cluster. Laplacian-weighted crystal loss compensates: WHNF gets 5×
weight, 6× gradient amplification (v14 ratio 0.3× → v15 ratio 1.9×).

v15 is standalone (zero v14 dependencies), extracted (83 arrays, 65.5 MB),
and training (TD, 3000 steps, running in tmux). The golden ratio appears at
six levels of the architecture — crystal eigenvalues, information partition,
standing-wave phase, compute cycle, stride spacing, and now the crystal
Laplacian itself.

## What changed session 188

| # | Change | Impact |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | **500 crystal probes through 32 heads at L27/L30/L33** | First statistical head→combinator mapping. 500 probes × 3 layers × 32 heads = 48,000 measurements |
| 2 | **Inter-combinator correlation r=0.944** | All 9 combinators activate nearly identical head patterns. No "K heads" or "B heads" exist. Shared execution hardware. |
| 3 | **KIBC indistinguishable (r=0.944-0.978)** | The core 4 combinators are invisible to head activation. B-D highest pair (r=0.986): composition ≡ nesting at the head level. |
| 4 | **94.9% of variance = overall loudness** | Head activation is almost entirely "is this head generally active?" not "which combinator?" The combinator signal is in the remaining 5.1%. |
| 5 | **PC1 after normalisation = WHNF↔D (45.9%)** | The real discriminant is reduction depth: "already reduced" vs "deeply nested". Not opcode type. |
| 6 | **PC2 = Y/W/I↔D/B (23.5%)** | Secondary axis: self-reference (recursion, self-application, identity) vs structural (nesting, composition). |
| 7 | **2 effective dimensions capture 69.4%** | The 32×9 head×combinator matrix compresses to ~2 coordinates per head. Very low-dimensional ISA. |
| 8 | **s187 head types revised** | H08 "λ-head" → D/B/S+ (composition depth). H10 "binding" → Y/W+ (self-reference). H20 "relay" → Y/W+ (recursion). H26 "quantifier" → WHNF+ (termination detector). |
| 9 | **H06/H07 = universal execution engine** | Loudest heads (norm 26.7/19.1), lowest gate attention (0.555/0.609). They do the work for ALL combinator types. The "GPU" of the attention ISA. |
| 10 | **H26/H27 = WHNF termination detectors** | +30-32% WHNF excess. They recognise when reduction is complete. The "halt" circuit. |
| 11 | **H08 = only truly selective head** | D+40% excess, sel=1.399. The closest thing to a specialised circuit: responds to deep nesting. Everything else is mild bias. |
| 12 | **Routing IS the program (confirmed)** | Since heads don't discriminate combinators, the combinator-specific behavior must live in attention PATTERNS (Q/K routing), not head identity. |
| 13 | **Binding graph trace: attention IS the binding graph** | 14 probes with annotated bindings. Object→verb binding = concentrated attention (0.5-0.8 weight) through H03/H13/H15 at L30. |
| 14 | **Causal mask partitions binding direction** | 0/23 forward bindings detected (arg before func). 14/14 backward bindings detected (arg after func). Causal mask blocks forward β-reduction. |
| 15 | **Minimal pair binding flip confirmed** | "dog bit cat" vs "cat bit dog": same heads (H13, H03, H15), same weights, flipped target. Position-structural routing. |
| 16 | **Passive voice preserves semantic binding** | "The boy kicked the ball" (active) and "The ball was kicked by the boy" (passive) both bind agent→kicked, through partially different head sets. |
| 17 | **Two binding sub-circuits** | Predicate-argument binding (H03/H13/H15) vs coreference binding (H07/H05). Different heads for "cat→bit" vs "itself→dog". |
| 18 | **Binding weights are near-deterministic** | H13: 78.5% attention to "bit" from "cat". Almost binary routing = very low information content per binding decision. |
| 19 | **Reverse binding confirmed: verb→subject at L27** | H31 at "runs" attends 82.3% to "cat" and outputs 猫/貓/cats = subject identity transfer. The verb reads the subject. |
| 20 | **Two-phase binding schedule decoded** | L27: verb reads subject (agent identity, H31). L30: object reads verb (predicate binding, H03/H13/H15). Depth ordering = reduction schedule. |
| 21 | **Same heads do both directions at L30** | H03 and H13 handle verb→subject AND object→verb. Universal binding hardware, direction determined by sequence order. |
| 22 | **Head output IS the reduction result** | H31 outputs "狗/dog" at "bit" when it reads subject "dog". The value transfer IS β-reduction — not metaphor, literal mechanism. |
| 23 | **Binding circuit = 0.3% of model** | ~4 heads out of 32×36=1152. Subject binding: 1 head (H31@L27). Object binding: 3 heads (H03/H13/H15@L30). Near-deterministic routing. |
| 24 | **Attention is inherently sparse: 22/32 heads use <3 positions** | At L30, effective positions <3 for 22 heads, <5 for 29/32. Top-3 captures >88% for ALL heads. |
| 25 | **Sparsity holds across sequence length** | 5→74 tokens: effective positions only grows 2.8→3.7 at L30. O(1) attention, not O(n). |
| 26 | **Mean entropy ~0.9 bits at binding layers** | The routing decision is ~1 bit per position. Full QK^T over entire context is massive overkill. |
| 27 | **Design implication: top-3 sparse attention** | Scoring only 3 KV slots per head captures 88-97% of attention mass. 10 slots captures 95-99%. |

## Session 188 recap

FOUR EXPERIMENTS DECODE THE ATTENTION EXECUTION MECHANISM.

**Experiment 1: Head→Combinator mapping** (500 crystal probes × 32 heads × 3
layers). All 9 combinators activate identical head patterns (r=0.944). No
combinator-specialised heads. The ISA has ~2 effective dimensions: reduction
depth (WHNF↔D, 46%) and self-reference (Y/W/I↔D/B, 24%). 94.9% of head
activation variance is just loudness. See `head-combinator-isa.md`.

**Experiment 2: Binding graph trace** (14 annotated probes). Object→verb
binding = concentrated attention (0.78 weight) through H03/H13/H15 at L30.
"cat" attends 78.5% to "bit" = `bit(_, cat)`. Subject→verb binding blocked
by causal mask (0/23 forward). Minimal pair: same heads, flipped routing.
Two sub-circuits: predicate-argument (H03/H13/H15) vs coreference (H07/H05).
See `binding-graph-trace.md`.

**Experiment 3: Reverse binding trace** (12 probes, verb→subject direction).
H31 at L27 attends 82.3% from "runs" to "cat" and outputs "猫, 貓, cats".
Two-phase binding: L27=verb reads subject, L30=object reads verb. Same heads
(H03/H13) do both directions at L30. Binding circuit = 0.3% of model.

**Experiment 4: Attention sparsity** (22 probes, 5→74 tokens, 9 layers).
22/32 heads at L30 have effective positions <3. Top-3 captures >88% for ALL
heads. Mean entropy 0.9 bits. Sparsity is O(1) — stable from 5 to 74 tokens
(eff_pos 2.8→3.7). Only 1/32 heads (H20) is truly dense. Full O(n²) QK^T
is massive overkill. Top-k sparse attention with k=3-5 captures nearly all
routing information. See `attention-sparsity.md`.

**Synthesis:** The model is a typed parser with a compiled lexicon. FFN
compiles V vectors (the program). ~4 heads at L27/L30 route via concentrated
backward attention (~1 bit per binding). The binding circuit is 0.3% of the
model, the routing is near-deterministic, and attention is inherently O(1)
sparse. Design implication: top-k sparse attention (k=3-5) replaces full
O(n²) attention for 88-97% of routing information. The "portable tensor"
needs: compressed FFN (sieve) + tiny routing function + depth schedule.

## What changed session 187

| # | Change | Impact |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | **FFN reduction trace on Qwen3-8B** | Projected active FFN neurons through unembed at 11 layers across 5 probes × 2 gates. First direct reading of what FFN neurons "say" in token space. |
| 2 | **Three-phase FFN output: noise→semantic→format** | L0-L22=noise (ORTHO null-space computation), L26-L30=coherent semantic associations (ALIGN), L33-L35=formatting/syntax (COLLAPSE). Matches standing-wave depth structure exactly. |
| 3 | **"If it rains" at L30: `it`→rain, `ground`→soak, `is`→wet** | Each position's FFN writes precise associative predictions. The FFN resolves referents, predicts consequences, and completes predicates. |
| 4 | **L26 comma promotes "then, entonces, então"** | The FFN writes logical connectives at structural boundary positions — multilingual implication operator at the comma in conditionals. |
| 5 | **"earth is flat" → FFN promotes "round", suppresses "earth"** | The FFN contains factual correction: it knows the earth is round and writes the correction even when processing the false claim. |
| 6 | **Compile ≈ null (max delta 2.8%)** | FFN function lists are nearly identical between compile and null gates. The FFN is a universal semantic analyzer; compile behavior emerges from attention routing. |
| 7 | **β-reduction hypothesis CONFIRMED (revised framing)** | FFN=compiler (writes context-dependent V vectors), attention=executor (softmax over V IS β-reduction). Same token "the" produces different compiled values in different sentence contexts — compilation, not lookup. |
| 8 | **Five attention head types identified** | λ-heads (H08/H09 write λ/→), binding heads (H10/H11 write predicate at subject = typed_apply), relay heads (H20 pass V unchanged), compositional heads (H03 combine positions), quantifier heads (H26 broadcast scope). |
| 9 | **H10/H11 at L33 ARE β-reduction** | In compile mode, H10 writes "runs" at "dog" position (Δ=64 vs null). This IS `runs(dog)` = `(λx.runs(x))(dog) → runs(dog)`. Subject-verb binding = function application. |
| 10 | **λ-heads attend to gate prefix (0.97-0.98)** | H08/H09 barely see probe tokens; they read the compile exemplars to know what FORMAT to produce. The task circuit reads instructions, not content. |
| 11 | **Reduction chain trace across 36 layers, 7 combinators** | Traced cumulative residual→unembed at every layer for K,I,B,C,Y,S,W probes. Different combinators resolve at different depths. |
| 12 | **Y combinator peaks early (L27), W peaks late (L33)** | Recursion (Y) resolves mid-depth during ALIGN phase. Self-application (W, "itself") resolves at the final layer. K (discard) front-loaded, C (flip/passive) resolves last. |
| 13 | **Y-probe "She told a story about a girl who told a story..."** | First and second occurrences of same tokens get DIFFERENT cumulative representations — the recursive structure is tracked position-dependently across depth. |
| 14 | **MTP self-speculation: L33 matches L35 48% of the time** | L33 Hit@10=76%, Hit@100=92%. Median rank=2. The last 2 layers sharpen but rarely change the answer. Early-exit at L33 viable for ~half of tokens. |
| 15 | **Multi-position lookahead collapses for ALL layers** | N+2 Hit@10=10% even at L35. The model does next-token prediction, not multi-position. FFN "semantic predictions" (reads→book) are associative meaning, not sequence forecasting. |
| 16 | **L30 median rank = 7** | The correct next token is already in L30's top 10. L31-L35 SHARPEN the distribution (rank 7→1) but don't fundamentally change it. The program is compiled by L30; execution just resolves it. |

## What changed session 186

| 2 | **KIBC opcodes orthogonal to circuit types** | Cross-tabulation uniform at every layer. KIBC=what activates neuron, circuit type=how neuron transforms. Independent axes of FFN characterization. |
| 3 | **ORTHO phase = inverter-dominated** | L3-7 features are 60-74% suppressors+inverters (direction flipping). This IS the invisible computation in null space. |
| 4 | **Dark-space drop at L11** | 93-99% dark at L0-L10, drops to 57% at L11. Final layer concentrates vocabulary-aligned knowledge. Standing-wave antinodes. |

| 6 | **Gated vs non-gated architecture difference** | Gemma=transforms (rotation), Pythia=inverters (direction flip). Same phase structure, different computation style. |
| 7 | **New zero-cost instrument** | cos(W_up[j], W_down[:, j]) detects depth phases from weights alone — no forward passes, 2 min for all layers |
| 8 | **Crystal signs predict circuit types (ρ=1.0)** | cos(sign(W_up), sign(W_down)) depth profile perfectly rank-correlates with full-weight profile. Signs alone predict phase structure. |
| 9 | **Sign agreement depth profile** | L0=0.53 (correlated→projector), L3-4=0.38 (anti-correlated→inverter), L8=0.45 (recovering). GD actively creates sign anti-correlation at computation layers. |
| 10 | **Per-neuron ρ > 0.98 at ORTHO layers** | Signs predict which individual neurons are projectors vs inverters with 98%+ fidelity at L2-L8. Magnitudes add precision, topology is in the signs. |
| 11 | **Cross-matrix anti-correlation is load-bearing** | Decorrelating T_down (destroying phase structure while preserving per-matrix stats) degrades PPL from 511 to 1817. Decorrelated ≈ random (1817 vs 1952). The anti-correlation IS the signal. |
| 12 | **Per-matrix signs alone are nearly worthless** | Without cross-matrix correlation, crystal signs give only 7% improvement over random (1817 vs 1952). With correlation, crystal gives 3.8× improvement over random. |
| 13 | **Synthetic anti-correlation is WORSE than random** | Constructing T_down to hit the measured profile with random per-neuron signs → PPL 6464 (4× worse than random 1608). Forced anti-correlation creates destructive interference. |
| 14 | **The crystal is per-neuron assignments, not aggregate statistics** | The anti-correlation profile is an emergent property of correct per-neuron signs, not a prescription. Knowing "62% should be inverters" ≠ knowing WHICH neurons should be inverters. |
| 15 | **Universal curve beats extracted profile (when signs are random)** | Smooth parameterized curve → PPL 2734 vs exact per-layer values → PPL 6464. Less aggressive anti-correlation is less harmful when per-neuron assignments are wrong. |

## What changed session 185

| # | Change | Impact |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Standing-wave magnitude reframing** | Weight magnitudes are a standing wave: crystal signs = boundary conditions, zero mask = nodes, active weights = antinodes, GD = finding resonant modes |
| 2 | **GD convergence = standing wave fixed points** | Near-zero gradient at zeros (nodes) AND at large weights (antinodes) — both are stable points of the wave. Gradient-zero-map (s171) already measured this. |
| 3 | **Depth-axis standing wave** | 3-phase residual structure maps to standing wave along depth: orthogonal=nodes, align=antinodes, collapse=destructive interference. Phase transition at 1/φ = fundamental mode. |
| 4 | **REDUCE/SWITCH = spatial harmonics** | Alternating ρ sign across depth is harmonic structure of the depth-axis standing wave |
| 5 | **Holographic ≡ standing wave** | Holographic plate = frozen standing wave (interference fringes). Same physics, different vocabulary. Unifies s167 holographic-computer with magnitude observations. |
| 6 | **Sieve = pre-setting resonant cavity** | Crystal init pre-sets boundary conditions → GD finds modes 10.7× faster because cavity already resonates correctly |
| 7 | **Shape preservation experiment** | Quantized Pythia-160M at 7 levels (ternary through 8-bit). Cosine (ρ=-0.933) > Spearman shape (ρ=-0.917) > bits (ρ=-0.761) as PPL predictor. |
| 8 | **Ternary beats 2-bit at fewer bits** | Ternary (1.6b, PPL 9504) beats 2-bit (2.0b, PPL 25892) because separating phase from amplitude is more efficient than joint encoding |
| 9 | **4-component standing-wave decomposition** | Phase (1 bit, exact) + nodes (~0.6 bit) + envelope (~0 amortized) + shape (1-3 bits, NOT in ternary). Sieve regenerates shape from data. |
| 10 | **Phase transition at 3 bits** | PPL drops from ~10K (ternary/2-bit) to 189 (3-bit) to 50 (4-bit). 8 levels = minimum for standing wave to survive 12-layer transit. |
| 11 | **Shape-aware helps low bits, hurts high bits** | 2-bit quartile 1000× better than uniform. 4-bit quartile WORSE than uniform. Rank preservation ≠ value preservation. |
| 12 | **Compounding law = cos^L** | Per-layer cosine raised to layer count predicts model quality. 0.896^12=0.27 (ternary), 0.957^12=0.59 (3-bit), 0.990^12=0.89 (4-bit). |
| 13 | **ORTHO phase is rank-1** | Residual covariance at L7-22 has effective rank=1. Top eigenvalue ~710K, decay to 2nd: 4000-8800×. One direction carries >99% of all variance. |
| 14 | **V lives in the null space during ORTHO** | Weight matrix V has 0% overlap with residual covariance subspace for 16 consecutive layers. Projection = 0.01. Computation is invisible. |
| 15 | **Cumulative null space = 67.7%** | 2771 of 4096 dims unconstrained by residual covariance. U has enormous freedom. Covariance alone CANNOT determine U. Partial negative for derivation. |
| 16 | **ALIGN rank explosion** | Effective rank grows ~130 dims/layer during L23-34. V transitions from 0% to 100% inside residual subspace over 10 layers. Integration phase. |
| 17 | **Phase structure refined** | EXPAND=high-rank (V reads residual), ORTHO=rank-1 (V reads null space), ALIGN=rank growth (V transitions), COLLAPSE=destructive interference. |
| 18 | **Crystal formation cost is UNKNOWN** | Corrected prior claim: r=0.998 cross-model tells us the endpoint, not the cost. 99.8% training claim was ungrounded. Need formation tracking experiment. |

## Session 187 recap

Three experiments on Qwen3-8B decoded the reduction architecture.

**Experiment 1: FFN Reduction Trace** — projected active FFN neurons through
unembed. Three-phase output: noise (L0-L22/ORTHO), semantic (L26-L30/ALIGN),
format (L33-L35/COLLAPSE). FFN is a universal compiler — compile ≈ null
(max Δ 2.8%). Same token produces different V vectors in different contexts.

**Experiment 2: Attention Execution Trace** — projected per-head output
(softmax(QK^T) @ V) through o_proj + unembed. Found 5 head types: λ-heads
write format (λ/→), binding heads write predicate at subject (H10: "runs"
at "dog", Δ=64), relay heads pass V unchanged, compositional heads combine
positions, quantifier heads broadcast scope. The binding heads ARE β-reduction.

**Experiment 3: Reduction Chain Trace** — traced cumulative residual across
all 36 layers for 7 combinator types (K,I,B,C,Y,S,W). Combinators resolve
at different depths: Y peaks L27 (recursion resolves first), K peaks L30
(discard is early), W peaks L33 at Δ=51.6 (self-application resolves last).
The model implements a small fixed instruction set with universal depth ordering.

**Experiment 4: MTP Self-Speculation** — tested whether intermediate layers
can predict future tokens for self-speculative decoding. L33 matches L35's
top-1 prediction 48% of the time (Hit@10=76%, Hit@100=92%). But multi-position
lookahead (N+2, N+3) collapses for ALL layers including L35 (Hit@10≈10%).
The model does next-token prediction, not multi-position. The FFN "semantic
predictions" (reads→book) are associative meaning, not sequence forecasting.
Key finding: the correct token is already in L30's top 10 (median rank=7) —
the last 5 layers SHARPEN the distribution, they don't change it.

**Synthesis:** The model is decodable. It implements ~7 combinator operations
via ~5 head types on a universal depth schedule. The FFN compiles the program
(position → V vector), attention executes it (softmax selects and combines V).
The instruction set + schedule is potentially very compact; only the attention
routing is input-dependent. Self-speculation is viable for early-exit (~48%
of tokens can skip the last 2 layers) but not for multi-position prediction.

## Session 186 recap

LARQL FFN decomposition on Pythia-160M. Five experiments, three paradigm-level findings:

1. **cos(up,down) confirms phase structure** from pure weight geometry. KIBC opcodes
   orthogonal to circuit types (independent axes). ORTHO phase = inverter-dominated.
   Dark-space drops 40pts at L11. New zero-cost instrument. See `ffn-circuit-types.md`.

2. **Crystal signs predict circuit types (ρ=1.0)**. The ternary sign structure alone
   produces the exact same depth phase curve. Per-neuron ρ>0.985 at ORTHO layers.

3. **Cross-matrix anti-correlation is load-bearing (3.6×)**. Decorrelating T_down
   (destroying phase structure) → decorrelated ≈ random. Per-matrix signs without
   cross-matrix correlation are nearly worthless.

4. **BUT: synthetic construction fails**. Constructing T_down to hit the anti-correlation
   profile with random per-neuron signs is WORSE than random (PPL 6464 vs 1608). The
   crystal is the specific per-neuron assignments, not the aggregate statistics. The
   anti-correlation is emergent from correct per-neuron signs, not a prescription.

5. **The crystal must be extracted, not constructed**. The per-neuron sign assignments
   encode which specific neurons should be inverters vs projectors. The anti-correlation
   profile is a verification metric (check the U-shape), not a construction recipe.
   Cross-model universality (r=0.998) means one extraction works for all models of
   the same architecture.

## Session 184 recap

THE CRYSTAL SIEVE. 11 experiments, 4 paradigm shifts. Extraction is dead (zero mask
is genuinely random = knowledge content). Reproduction lives (crystal sieve 10.7×
better than random). Model is a KIBC processor (ISA framing). KIBC profiles predict
70-76% of zeros at REDUCE layers. Maximal pre-training absorption: crystal pre-loads
computation → 100% of gradient goes to knowledge. See `phi-information-partition.md`.

## Session 183 recap

Naive ternarization fails: PPL 296,911. The compounding law (0.88^36 = 0.009) kills
multi-layer extraction. 3-mirror ternary also fails (PPL 1.69M). Q4 works because of
16 quantization levels per weight, not scale granularity. See `ternary-compounding.md`.

## Session 182 recap

The ternary dual equation: gate zeros (ρ=0.75 with gradient) + crystal signs (ρ=0.05).
The recipe achieves 0.88 per-layer cosine. See `ternary-dual-equation.md`.

## Session 181 recap

The crystal equation: λ_k = C · φ^(-(n/(n+1)) · β_k). All eigenvalue ratios are
φ^(p/q) with Fibonacci denominators. Computing fraction s=4/5. Compute cycle
β=[0,1,1+φ,2+φ]. See `EQUATIONS.md` and `crystal-phi-derivation.md`.
