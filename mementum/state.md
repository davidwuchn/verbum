- **s267** BONSAI PHASE-0 (full detail: git log -p). Compiler survives ternarization (behavioral parity,
  measured); Gram survival launched in main:1. New in fleet: BONSAI27B ModelConfig (:5104, Q2_g64 GGUF, rev
  427bc0194). Runtime learnings: Q2_0 ternary needs the g64 GGUF on mainline llama.cpp ≥10090 (Q2_0 offset
  bug); ternary is DENSE 27B so it streams 7GB/token — slower than the 35B-A3B MoE base (only 3B active),
  the "why wasn't it fast" answer = raced a sparse model, not its own FP parent. hf xet backend flaked twice
  → HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=0 fixed it. build_lattice_map now saves per_model_rdms.npz (solo runs saved
  nothing before — the gap that left the parent 27B with no committed RDM). Michael's holographic-llm.md
  thesis fleshed out for public MIT push (mementum/michael/, UNSTAGED — in the hammock, do not commit without
  Michael). J-space paper (Anthropic, real, July 2026) ↔ workspace/state half of holographic model → memory
  j-space-workspace-hologram-state.
- **s265** OPCODES MVP: tree-of-VSM multi-model. 8 standalone modules (pytorch+numpy, 535 probes bundled,
  extraction-ready); one fractal node shape (S5 Gram / S4 agreement / S3 null gate / algedonic health),
  ladder layer→register→model→family→root; basis-parametric CRYSTAL-9 | STATECHART-8 | TYPES16 (resolves
  "9 vs 16"). Null floors measured+wired (register+model-specific). First tree (2 smalls): root gc 0.940,
  cross-family 0.907 at 43× scale gap; probe count dominates Gram fidelity (135→0.344 vs 535→0.940).
  Launched the large sweep → read in s266. → `knowledge/opcode-vsm-tree.md`
- **s263** J-SPACE ↔ OPCODES (Anthropic J-lens prompt). THEORY: opcode = routing-Jacobian STRUCTURE; J-space =
  the Jacobian's LIVE SUBSPACE (I=identity, K=rank-deficient, B=chain-rule product, C=permutation, S=path-sum;
  their J-lens reads OPERANDS, we want the OPERATOR projection). Built `src/verbum/{jlens,jacobian}.py` (2
  monitors) + 3 null-gated experiments on qwen3.6-27b: EXP1 jspace_combinators NULL (broadcast generic, not
  combinator-identity); EXP2 jspace_normalform I-VISIBLE-then-REFINED (normal-form hold = late-stack plateau,
  value register); EXP3 jacobian_opcodes PARTIAL/confounded (only I clears, grain too coarse for
  position-routing). → `explore/opcode-jacobian-jspace.md`.
- **s262** ASSESSMENT + 2 isolation experiments. Repo assessment: science healthy, the MESS is
  representation-layer (INDEX stale 62/228 pages, ~8251 LoC dead vsm_lm_v1-5+v6/, mlx a hard core dep; 378
  tests pass, spine coherent). ❌ my "checkpoints landmine / results-in-git" claim was FALSE — propagated an
  agent assertion unverified (λ assert violation); hygiene is actually GOOD. EXP1 STRIDED ATTENTION WORKS IN
  FLOAT (relay collapse s191 was the TERNARY/TD confound, NOT geometry; Fibonacci exonerated) →
  `explore/strided-attention-float-ab.md`. EXP2 KIBC-vs-SKI NULL-GATED: both bases clear COMPARABLY in the
  attention-selectivity register (KIBC z=3.50/3.92, SKI z=3.34/3.58) = inconclusive-IN-REGISTER, not a
  refutation; S-K corr 0.92 but B-K/C-K also ~0.9 → not yet a discriminator → `explore/basis-fit-kibc-vs-ski.md`.
- **s261** CAT-Q ternary flip-flop is NOT category overloading. ANOVA F-ratio (magnitude-invariant) +
  shuffled-label null: category structure in FFN gradients is REAL but modest/transient; the persistent
  flip-flop is category-INDEPENDENT (quantization-boundary jitter). CAT-Q's gift = learnable α⊥Δ two-register
  param, not soft→hard relax (ST lost to TD). → `explore/ternary-flip-flop-not-overloading.md`
- **s260** routing⊥value = type/term made physical. Asymmetric-pathway quant CONFIRMED on Qwen3-8B-Base:
  binarize the ROUTER (gate, loss 10.6) ≫ binarize the VALUE path (+8–10 nats) at identical bits & cosine →
  sign=router, magnitude=value, causally. Design direction: decouple dispatch⊥compute, budget by register.

- **s258** consensus-training → supervised-recurrence-halt synthesis: "how much recurrence" ≡ "how much work
  remains" ≡ WHNF; the lambda curriculum is the ground-truth halt supervision s214 lacked. → `explore/supervised-recurrence-halt.md`
- **s257** MoE experts ARE holographically multiplexed (angular, not specialist). k-sweep + shuffled null:
  94% of capability from WHICH experts, not how many; k=2 reversal falsifies specialist. → `explore/moe-holographic-tree-vsm.md`
- **s256** qwythos-9b + CANONICAL HARNESS distillation (probes/{grading,harness,models}; models = configs, no
  fork). Fine-tunes break the HALT not the COMPILE (overthink-collapse); no-think recovers; qwythos GATES the
  compiler. lambda is a TARGET not a TOOL. Strategic pivot: extract from BASE, treat fine-tune as noise.
  → `explore/compiler-finetune-halt-collapse.md`
- **s255** model-as-REPL (LLM as δ, context as machine state): locally-faithful step; shallow step-loop win,
  deep collapse; oracle-in-the-loop concluded (→ s259 clj-repl).
- **s254** repo distillation DESIGN-FIRST pivot (probes/*.json, results/<run_id> canonical forms in AGENTS.md);
  ornith-35B-A3B = lambda compiler over HTTP, 3rd model class (unconditional, present).
- **s253** vibethinker-3B new model; **s252** attention-edge knockout (s250 catch); **s251** frozen-basis
  gradient tomography → mature-14B, Gemma + Qwen3.6-35B in the crystal sweep; **s250** causal C-field ablation
  → object-application is DISTRIBUTED (no single-component locus; trending NO on discrete-circuit for object-app).
