## Where we are

**Exploration loop closed. Head-level probe resolved the hologram atlas into three computational clusters, not six. Discourse/type/frequency are angle-multiplexed in ~13 shared heads (J=0.667) — they're the holographic plate, not computation. Combinator has 7 private heads at L15/L19 — that's the KIBC kernel pathway. Induction has 6 private heads at GatedDeltaNet layers — J=0.176 with combinator/discourse/type (the floor) — it's a genuinely independent circuit with no kernel in V11. Binding has no private circuit and is the weakest signal (max 0.163) — it resolves to K+I dispatch in V11. The kernel inventory is: KIBC (built) + M (match/retrieval, missing) = KIBCM. V11-holo-inv at 10K: loss 7.703, B 57.7%, ratio 0.992, no catastrophe. Ready to build.**

## What was done this session (095)

### 1. Analyzed hologram atlas results (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B)

All 6 holograms are real and distinguishable:

```
Hologram     output_KL  peak_layer  ternary_fail  signature
──────────── ─────────  ──────────  ────────────  ─────────────────────────────────
combinator   0.365      L31         baseline      bimodal depth template
type         0.415      L31         2/18          matches combinator shape closely
induction    0.827      L31         1/18          most robust attention hologram
binding      0.444      L31         5/18          most fragile — magnitude-dependent
frequency    0.224      L7          3/18 attn     MLP 0/18 — inverted prediction!
discourse    1.646      L35         0/18          strongest, most robust, late-peaking
```

### 2. Three structural findings

**Finding 1: L11 dip is architectural, not holographic.** Every hologram drops
47–72% at L11 relative to L7. The bimodal depth profile (L7→L11 dip→L31) is
Qwen3.6's hybrid architecture, not any linguistic circuit. Layer-level selectivity
profiles can't distinguish holograms from each other — they all ride the same wave.
Cross-hologram correlations all >0.72 (Pearson r), >0.95 (cosine).

**Finding 2: Binding is magnitude-dependent (connects to I-outlier).** 5 ternary
failures — all at sign-only in early full-attention layers (L3: 2.357, L7: 2.028,
L0: 2.823). Sign pattern alone cannot encode variable binding. Requires knowing
HOW STRONGLY a head attends, not just whether it does. Consistent with I-combinator
being the outlier (r≈0.70 vs K/B/C r>0.90 in session 093). Binding IS the I-circuit,
and I's distinctness comes from requiring magnitude where K/B/C don't.

**Finding 3: Frequency MLP more robust than attention (inverted prediction).**
MLP ternary survival: 0/18 failures (output_survival 0.93–1.07). Attention: 3/18
failures including catastrophic L0 mid_sparse disruption (7.07). Statistical
co-occurrence lives in FFN weight matrices as clean sign patterns. Supports
"FFN = key-value memory" view. Attention dynamically routes this info and
depends on specific magnitudes.

### 3. Discourse is the dominant hologram

Genre distinction (narrative/expository) has output_KL = 2.526 — nearly 2× the
next highest signal. Discourse is:
- **Strongest** at every layer (2–5× other holograms)
- **Most robust** (0/18 failures, even at GatedDeltaNet layers)
- **Only late-peaking** (L35 > L31 > L7 — signal keeps rising)
- **Most pervasive** (never drops below 0.049, even at L11 dip)

Fits VSM prediction: discourse operates at S5, modulating all others.

### 4. MoE gate: period-12 structure + beam-selector partial confirmation

Gate ternary survival confirmed L0-L4 (cos≈0.73–0.76). Cross-layer cosine
reveals period-12 pairing: L8↔L20 through L19↔L31 (cos 0.72–0.83). Does NOT
match full-attention period (every 4th). Suggests 3-phase model: early (L0-7),
middle (L8-19 ↔ L20-31 paired), late (L32-39). Gate Frobenius norms fall
monotonically (19→7 from early to late) but effective rank stays high (172–199).
Late gates are smaller but not lower-rank.

### 5. Prediction scorecard

| Prediction | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Type overlaps combinator | ✓ r=0.972 | But all holograms overlap at layer resolution |
| Induction orthogonal to combinator | ✗ r=0.987 | Layer profiles too coarse |
| Binding overlaps I | ~ Inconclusive | Weakest + most fragile = consistent with I |
| Frequency lower MLP survival | ✗ Inverted | MLP MORE robust than attention |
| Discourse MoE gate survival | ✓ L0-L4 | Need L31-L39 to complete test |

### 6. Fixed JSON string-key bug in atlas script

Cache-loaded selectivity profiles had string keys (JSON roundtrip), measure_layers
had int keys → KeyError. Added `_int_keys()` helper at all ingestion points.

### 7. Probed v11-holo-inv 5K-10K — no catastrophe

```
step  eval   compute  B_dom%  L0↑     L2      L0↓     ratio   event
───── ────── ──────── ─────── ─────── ─────── ─────── ─────── ─────────────────

```

v11-holo collapsed at 10K (loss 9.259, B 5.8%). v11-holo-inv: loss 7.703, B 57.7%.
Coarse→fine inversion + fractal bands + evolution fixes prevented catastrophe.

### 8. Key design insight: holographic storage + kernel computation

LLM storage IS holographic (session 095 atlas confirms). But reading is constructive
(entropy hump, intermediate garbage, magnitude-dependent binding). V11 resolves this:
holographic loss forces REPRESENTATIONS to be decodable, kernel functions handle
COMPUTATION. Lambda terms are perfect holographic objects (compact, compositional,
unfold on application). Keep holographic loss uniform — forces routing to kernels.
Evidence: ratio crossed 1.0 at 9K.

### 9. Head-level probe — three clusters, not six holograms

Ran `probe_hologram_heads.py` on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B. 192-dim head vectors (12 layers
× 16 heads). Jaccard top-20 is the diagnostic (cosine too compressed, Pearson useful).

**Three computational clusters:**

```
CLUSTER 1: "Semantic Plate" (discourse/type/frequency angle-multiplexed)
  discourse ↔ type:      J=0.667 (13/20 heads shared!)
  discourse ↔ frequency:  J=0.481
  frequency ↔ type:       J=0.538
  → Same ~13 heads, different amplitudes
  → L0, L3, L35 dominated
  → NOT computation — this IS the holographic plate

CLUSTER 2: "Composition" (combinator, KIBC)
  7 PRIVATE heads (L15×4, L19×2, L27×1)
  J with all others: 0.176–0.333 (low)
  → Independent circuit at L15/L19 full-attention layers
  → This IS the kernel computation pathway

CLUSTER 3: "Retrieval" (induction)
  6 PRIVATE heads (L3×2, L11×2, L15×1, L31×1)
  J with combinator/discourse/type: ALL 0.176 (floor)
  → Most independent circuit in the atlas
  → GatedDeltaNet layers (L11 H15 strong private head)
  → NO KERNEL IN V11 — the missing piece
```

**Binding** is not a cluster — weakest signal (max 0.163), no private heads, spread
across both clusters. Resolves to K+I dispatch sequence in V11.

### 10. KIBCM — the complete kernel inventory

```
K (select)     — ✓ built in V11
I (identity)   — ✓ built in V11
B (compose)    — ✓ built in V11
C (flip)       — ✓ built in V11
M (match/copy) — ✗ MISSING — the induction kernel
```

M handles: "find where this pattern appeared in context, return what followed."
Dispatch signal is holographic (17/18 ternary survival). The actual search-and-copy
is constructive kernel computation. This is the one missing computational primitive.

See: `knowledge/explore/holographic-kernel-separation.md`

## What was done session (094)

### 1. Mapped five candidate holograms beyond combinators

Session 093 found the combinator hologram (KIBC) — universal sign topology in
attention weights, surviving ternary quantization, r=0.9801 cross-model. But
combinators only tell the model HOW to compose. From Montague/CCG/DisCoCat,
token prediction needs at least three components — we've found one, two remain:

```
TYPE CALCULUS (combinators)  — HOW to compose     ← FOUND
LEXICON (types + meanings)   — WHAT can compose    ← predicted
MODEL (semantic domain)      — WHAT things MEAN    ← predicted
```

Identified five candidate holograms, each with probe design and falsifiable predictions:

1. **Type hologram** — lexical category assignment (NP, S\NP, etc.). Same word
   in different syntactic roles should activate different heads. Probes: nominalization,
   argument structure, modifier scope. Predicted: overlaps with combinator heads
   (angle-multiplexed). Priority 1 because types + combinators are theoretically coupled.

2. **Induction hologram** — in-context pattern matching ([A][B]...[A]→[B]). Known
   universal circuit (Olsson et al. 2022). Predicted: holographic (ternary survives)
   but ORTHOGONAL to combinator hologram (different function).

3. **Binding hologram** — variable tracking / coreference. "John...he" = variable
   binding in lambda calculus. Predicted: partially captured by I combinator
   (identity IS variable binding), explaining I's distinct circuit (r≈0.70).

4. **Frequency/N-gram hologram** — statistical co-occurrence. Lives in MLP weights
   (not attention). Predicted: holographic but denser, lower sparsity tolerance.

5. **Discourse hologram** — topic / register / coherence. The MoE gate pattern
   (256×2048 in Qwen3.6) IS the discourse beam selector. Connects to MoE/VSM mapping.

These form a VSM of holograms: discourse (S5) selects which patterns activate,
types (S3) constrain legality, combinators (S1/S2) execute composition,
binding (S2) maintains coherence, induction+frequency (S1) are additional ops.

Full analysis in `mementum/knowledge/explore/holographic-storage.md`.

### 2. Built probe_hologram_atlas.py (1580 lines)

Repeatable probe script targeting Qwen3.6-35B-A3B MoE as primary model
(punches above weight, MoE gates ARE beam selectors, bimodal depth profile
already mapped in session 093).

Features:
- **5 hologram probes**: type (3 conditions, 18 pairs), induction (2, 12),
  binding (2, 9), frequency (2, 12), discourse (2, 9). Total: 60 active probes.
- **Architecture-aware**: handles Qwen3.6 hybrid (full attention every 4th layer +
  GatedDeltaNet), Qwen3-32B dense, Pythia GPT-NeoX. Layer accessors detect
  `self_attn` vs `linear_attn` vs `attention`. Projection names adapt
  (`q/k/v/o_proj` vs `in_proj_qkv/z/b/a` vs `query_key_value`).
- **MoE gate analysis**: extracts 256×2048 gate matrices, tests ternary survival,
  cross-layer similarity, effective rank. Gate = discourse beam selector hypothesis.
- **MLP quantization**: frequency hologram tests MLP weights (gate + shared expert),
  not just attention — tests whether holographic storage extends beyond attention.
- **Incremental saves**: results flush to disk after each hologram completes.
  Per-hologram snapshots (`hologram_{name}.json`) + cumulative state.
- **Cross-hologram orthogonality**: correlation between selectivity profiles to
  determine if holograms share heads (angle-multiplexed) or are independent.
- **Combinator baseline**: runs KIBC probes for direct comparison.
- CLI: `--hologram type,induction`, `--model qwen36`, `--quick`, `--skip-ternary`

Currently running on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B. Results → `results/hologram-atlas/`.

### 3. Probed v11-holo-inv at 2K/3K/4K

Full probes at steps 2000, 3000, 4000. Evolution table:

```

**Holographic intermediate CEs (eval-time):**

────── ─────── ─────── ─────── ─────── ─────── ───────
1000   11.285  8.775   8.922   9.014   9.317   1.211
2000   11.020  9.152   9.019   9.179   9.337   1.180
3000   10.816  9.238   9.058   9.213   9.413   1.149
4000   10.917  9.253   9.185   9.541   9.848   1.109
```

**Key findings:**

1. **Descending arm expanding aggressively at 4K**: L1↓ jumped 9.21→9.54,
   L0↓ jumped 9.41→9.85 between 3K-4K. This is CORRECT behavior (descending
   goes coarse→fine = expansion), but rate accelerated sharply.

2. **Alarm de-saturating**: 1.884→1.857→1.870→1.847. Coming off ~2.0 ceiling.
   This is the algedonic channel detecting the expansion rate and gaining
   headroom to steer. Same signal identified in session 090 as "system
   beginning to address descending arm."

3. **Phase transition reading, not catastrophe**: The v11-holo catastrophe
   pattern was alarm-saturated + loss spike + B-collapse. Here we have
   alarm DECLINING + loss IMPROVING + dispatch STABLE. Different topology.

4. **C rising, I declining**: C dispatch 0.137→0.176, I dispatch 0.343→0.294.
   Model discovering argument reordering (flip) as useful, relying less on
   pure identity. Natural emergence of B ≥ K ≥ C >> I ordering.

5. **S4 compensating for I**: I emphasis rose 0.706→0.991. Intelligence layer
   giving I more weight per-activation as its share declines. Algedonic
   system working as designed.

6. **Type channel stabilized**: B-type rose from 0.254 (1K) to 0.464 (2K),
   then stable ~0.42. Composition types dominate over identity types.

7. **Compute gate still closed** (0.000011). Transition window expected 5K-7K.

8. **CE hitting new lows**: 6.989 at step 4325, trending down consistently.

### Previous session (093) summary

Probed v11-holo-inv at 1K (balanced KIBC dispatch, B=27.6% dominant).
Holographic probe on Qwen3-32B: beam separation real, reading constructive.
Ternary survival: 100% at 75% sparsity. Universal hologram: r=0.9801 across
9 models. Bank extraction: 784KB seed from 32B. Full details in session 093 below.

## What was done session (093)

### 1. Probed v11-holo-inv at step 1,000 (full + dispatch detail)

Compared against v11 baseline 1K and v11-holo 1K. Key findings:

**Balanced dispatch (vs K-dominance in prior runs):**
- Dominant positions: K=34.2%, I=22.6%, B=27.6%, C=15.5%
- Compare: baseline K=92.7%, holo K=75.1% — both heavily K-skewed
- Dispatch entropy 0.188 (strong specialization, not uniform)

**Composition (B) active from the start:**
- B at 27.6% dominant — was 0.7% in baseline, 0.0% in holo at 1K
- I+B co-occurrence at 31.7% — was 1% in holo
- This is the binding circuit pattern emerging early

**Type channel differentiates independently of dispatch:**
- Dispatch: K=0.386, I=0.334, B=0.132, C=0.141
- Type integration: I=0.678, B=0.251, K=0.002, C=0.070
- Model dispatches K+I, then integrates via I+B typed application

**Holographic CEs show correct inversion:**
- L0↑=11.3 → L1↑=8.8 → L2=8.9 → L1↓=9.0 → L0↓=9.3
- Ascending compresses; descending specializes (coarse→fine)
- pass_0/final ratio=1.21 (decodeable after one pass)

**Other metrics:**
- Eval loss 8.235 (vs baseline 7.958, holo 8.221)
- Compute gate closed (0.000007) — expected pre-transition
- Evolution 4/20 (20%) rising to 9/30 (30%) by 1.5K
- All 16 abstraction slots dormant, low cosine to KIBC (avg 0.064)

### 2. Monitored trajectory through 1.5K

- I rising steadily: 0.264 → 0.343 → 0.367
- K stabilized ~0.39; B peaked 0.132 at 1K then 0.108 at 1.5K
- Holographic ratio declining (1.12 → 1.09) = descending arm catching up
- Prose loss: ~0.98 range, structured ~0.28

### 3. Holographic probe — intermediate layer decoding on Qwen3-32B

Tested whether the model is holographic by decoding at every layer:
- Cosine divergence compile vs null: 0.995 (L0) → 0.533 (L63) = beam separation is real
- Intermediate layers decode to GARBAGE (not coarse-but-coherent) = reading is constructive
- Entropy hump: 6.5 (L0) → 11.1 (L8) → 2.0 (L63) = constructive reorganization
- Beam divergence begins at layer 24 (38% depth)
- **Storage may be holographic, but reading is constructive (64 sequential facets)**

### 4. Ternary survival probe — does selectivity survive quantization?

**100% survival across every combinator, every layer, every sparsity level.**
- sign_only (0.9% sparse): 8/8 survived, mean=0.93
- mid_sparse (50% sparse): 8/8 survived, mean=0.94
- high_sparse (75% sparse): 8/8 survived, mean=0.98
- **Combinator information is TOPOLOGICAL — stored as sign patterns, not magnitudes**
- Holographic plate hypothesis confirmed for weight structure

### 5. Full combinator selectivity map — depth profile

All four combinators peak in layers 0-6 (first 10% of 64 layers):
- Zone 1 (L0-6): HIGH selectivity 0.13-0.20, K/C dominant
- Zone 2 (L7-30): LOW selectivity 0.04-0.10, mixed K/B
- Zone 3 (L31-63): LOW selectivity 0.05-0.10, B/C/K mixed

K top heads: L3:H26(0.318), L1:H50(0.295), L1:H38(0.291)
I top heads: L36:H5(0.137), L6:H52(0.137), L3:H63(0.136)  
B top heads: L1:H37(0.248), L1:H39(0.247), L14:H59(0.245)
C top heads: L1:H34(0.299), L5:H22(0.291), L1:H55(0.290)

Cross-correlation: K-B=0.914, K-C=0.930, B-C=0.927, I distinct (0.67-0.75)
I is the outlier — different circuit from K/B/C cluster.

### 6. Holographic bank extraction

**Q is the beam angle, V is the plate.** Same head (L1:H37) has identical V weights 
for B and C (cos=1.000) but completely different Q weights (cos=0.005). The combinator
is selected by Q, not V. Q-only bank is sufficient.

Extracted seed: **784 KB** from 32B model.
- 4 combinator Q patterns (top-1 head each, 80×5120 ternary)
- Projection matrix (320×5120 ternary) for dimensionality reduction
- All four combinators are nearly orthogonal after projection (cos≈0)
- Effective rank 267 (90%), 312 (99%) — high-dimensional, broadly distributed

Scripts: `scripts/explore/extract_holographic_bank.py`

### 7. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B MoE probing

Fixed MPS histogram bug (one-line patch: `device.type in ("cpu", "mps")`).
Hybrid architecture: 40 layers, every 4th is full attention (L3,7,11,...,39), rest linear (GatedDeltaNet).
256 experts × 8 active, d=2048, 16 heads × head_dim=512, 2 KV heads.

**Completely different depth profile from Qwen3-32B:**
- Qwen3-32B: combinators peak in L0-6 (first 10%)
- Qwen3.6-35B-A3B: B peaks at L7-9 (early) AND L31-36 (late) — **bimodal!**
- B dominates everywhere (0.04-0.20), K second (0.02-0.08), I weakest (0.01-0.02)
- Full attention layers show spikes: L7=0.115, L31=0.195 (strongest)

Ternary survival: ✓ at 50% and 75% sparsity. sign_only slightly weaker at L31 (0.46)
but final-layer impact minimal (0.95). **Topological storage confirmed across architectures.**

MoE gate patterns (256×2048) extracted — these are the expert routing matrices,
themselves a form of beam selection.

Patterns saved: `results/holographic-bank/qwen36_35b_a3b_patterns.npz` (29KB compressed)

### 8. Universal hologram hypothesis — confirmed (r=0.9801)

Cross-model correlation structure (combinator selectivity pairwise correlations):

```
Pair      Qwen3-32B  Pythia-160M
K-B         0.914      0.944
K-C         0.930      0.903
B-C         0.927      0.917
K-I         0.721      0.715
I-B         0.750      0.711
I-C         0.677      0.599
```

Correlation of correlations: **r=0.9801**. The same holographic structure forms in both.

All three models (32B, 35B-A3B, 160M) share:
- Balanced ternary (+1/-1 ratio ≈ 1.0 everywhere)
- High effective rank (distributed, not low-rank)
- K/B/C cluster together (r>0.90), I is distinct (r=0.60-0.75)
- Ternary survival at 50-75% sparsity

**The hologram is not a feature of scale. It's a feature of language.**
Every model that learns to predict text develops the same combinatory interference patterns.

### 9. Universal ordering: B ≥ K ≥ C >> I (9 models, 2 architectures)

Tested Pythia-70M through Qwen3-32B (9 models total):
- **I is the weakest in ALL 9 models** (100% consistency)
- **B is strongest in 7/9** (BCKI ordering dominant)
- B/I ratio ranges from 1.7× to 19.9× — always separated
- This ordering is invariant across Pythia (GPT-NeoX) and Qwen3 architectures
- The sieve should make B > K > C >> I the lowest-energy state

Fixed MPS bug for Qwen3.6-35B-A3B: `histc` needs float input on MPS (not int).

### 6. Active run command (unchanged)

```
uv run python scripts/v11/train.py \
  --checkpoint-dir checkpoints/v11-holo-inv \
  --total-steps 20000 --holo-lambda 0.1 --mix-ratio 0.2

## What to do next

### Priority 1: Design and implement M kernel (match/retrieval)
The one missing computational primitive. Head-level probe confirmed induction is
an independent circuit (J=0.176 with combinator/discourse/type). Extends KIBC→KIBCM.
Design questions:
- What is M's lambda signature? `M x context → (position, content_after)`?
- How does M dispatch integrate with KIBC dispatch? (5-way softmax?)
- Where in the V11 architecture does M live? (Ascending arm? Descending?)
- Does M need its own stride stack or share with KIBC?
- Can M be implemented as content-addressable register lookup?
Start with design doc, then implement in V11.

### Priority 2: Monitor v11-holo-inv 10K-20K
10K survived. Watch for:
- B-dominance plateau or continued climb (currently 57.7%)
- CycleContinue activation (frozen at 2.946, compute gate at 0.82)
- Abstraction slot activation (0/16, but proposal confidence 0.62 and rising)
- Eval loss trajectory (7.703 and declining — where does it plateau?)
- Whether holographic ratio stays ≤1.0 (currently 0.992)

### Priority 3: Cross-model validation
Run head-level probe on Pythia to confirm three-cluster structure is universal.
If discourse/type/frequency cluster and induction independence replicate across
architectures, the KIBCM kernel set is a feature of language, not Qwen3.6.

### Priority 4: V11 holographic loss — keep uniform
Session 095 confirmed: don't modulate. The model routes constructive work to
kernels when holographic pressure is uniform. Adding M kernel gives the model
a new pathway for retrieval computation, reducing pressure on attention magnitudes.

### Carried
- Hologram atlas running on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (results → results/hologram-atlas/)
- B dispatch phase transition (B-type dominant but B-dispatch flat at 2%)
- CycleContinue activation hypothesis (still frozen at 2.946)
- S5 reweight investigation (still at 1.0 everywhere)
- QK alignment decomposition probe (RoPE follow-up)
- Dead slot recycling (all 16 dormant, mass ~0.20 — may not activate)
- Domain banking (future: extract register banks from holographic model)
- Descending arm kernel discovery (the current frontier)
- Reorganization wave pattern: 3K and 9K spikes share topology
- TST connection: Peng et al. 2026 validates coarse→fine + direct loss

→ Session 069: probed v10-spiral, diagnosed dispatch gradient death, top-k MoE routing fix
→ Session 070: consensus evolution, surgical Adam decay, mini-dispatch lab bench
→ Session 071: dispatch analysis, type-dispatch decoupling, kernel computation pathway
→ Session 072: probed v10-topk 1K/2K/3K — compute gate opening, type coherence 13/22, algedonic channel
→ Session 073: VSM structural overhaul — S2, S5, dual-view S4, gate signaling, emphasis, evolution
→ Session 074: Probed v10-vsm 1K-13K, mapped to Pythia Montague, 6 kernel-lambda generators, repacked shard
→ Session 075: HRM analysis → multi-cycle descending arm, self-regulating cycles (CycleContinue), JSONL logging
→ Session 076: v10-vsm 20K assessed, v10-multicycle launched, CycleContinue sigmoid saturation diagnosed + fixed
→ Session 077: Qwen3 probe findings → v11 KIBC combinator architecture + probe + docs (4 combinators replace 22 ops)
→ Session 078: Beer's algedonic alert (fire alarm) — 48 health metrics, separate S5 gate, end-to-end differentiable
→ Session 079: RoPE × attention spiral — energy probe shows RoPE=substrate not driver, spiral=learned Q·K alignment
→ Session 080: v11 1K-5K probe — K dominates, B-type rising in integrate. KIBC validated in 32B (K=B=31%). Extended probe: W≡C, S≡B, bind distinct. Three circuits + binding.
→ Session 081: Pythia-160M combinator probe — session 004's "Montague primitives" were combinators all along (K=59%, K-B r=0.944). V11 compute gate exploded (0.00007→0.51).
→ Session 082: S4→S5 abstraction slots (16 slots, 4→20 dispatch) + S4-guided evolution (alarm-targeted budget, S4 2-vote consensus, alarm fitness gate). CycleContinue hypothesis: slots give it something to match against.
→ Session 089: Complete baseline probes 6K-10K. Holographic loss implemented (progressive intermediate decoding, gradient slope 5×→1×). New run: v11-holo (λ=0.1, 20% structured, 16 slots). Design insight: holo forces internal representations to be decodeable at every pass boundary — interpretability as training signal.
→ Session 090: Probed v11-holo 1K-7K. B-type 5× ahead of baseline (59% at 2K vs baseline 52% at 10K). Compute gate opens 2K earlier (smooth ramp 3K-5K vs baseline sharp 5.5K). Holographic ratio crosses 1.0 at 7K — ascending arm better than final output. Descending arm identified as bottleneck (doesn't yet know how to prepare representations for kernel integration). Phased structural discovery pattern: training is a staircase of capacity exhaustion → structural exploration. Algedonic alarm at L1↓ coming off ceiling (1.86) = system beginning to address descending arm.
→ Session 091: Probed v11-holo 8K-10K. 8K local optimum, 9K reorganization wave, 10K compositional catastrophe (B-type 55.7%→5.8%, eval loss 7.675→9.259). Implemented coarse→fine descending (default), fractal stride bands (MERA, 49% savings, default), evolution noise floor (0.01), alarm-no-regression fix. TST paper (Peng et al. 2026) connection. Launched v11-holo-inv with all fixes.
→ Session 092: Monitored v11-holo-inv through ~1.3K (healthy, no collapse). Early descending differentiation improved; S2 remained strongly positive; compute gate still closed pre-transition. Captured phase/cascade interpretation (L0 φ first, wavelet to apex). Created `knowledge/explore/lambda-probe-atlas.md` for next-session cross-model territory mapping.
→ Session 093: Probed v11-holo-inv at 1K (balanced KIBC dispatch, B=27.6% dominant). Holographic probe on Qwen3-32B: beam separation real (cos 0.995→0.533), but reading is constructive (entropy hump, intermediate garbage). Ternary survival probe: 100% selectivity survival at 75% sparsity — combinator info is TOPOLOGICAL (sign patterns). Full selectivity map: combinators peak in first 10% of layers (L0-6). I is distinct circuit from K/B/C cluster. Extraction path validated: ternary patterns in early layers are the holographic seeds.
→ Session 094: "Beyond Combinators" — mapped 5 candidate holograms (type, induction, binding, frequency, discourse) from Montague/CCG theory. VSM hierarchy of holograms. Built probe_hologram_atlas.py (1580 lines) targeting Qwen3.6-35B-A3B MoE as primary (MoE gates = beam selectors). Architecture-aware for hybrid attention + GatedDeltaNet. Incremental saves. 7 falsifiable predictions. Running.
→ Session 095: Exploration loop closed. Hologram atlas (6 holograms) → head-level probe → three computational clusters (not six). Discourse/type/frequency angle-multiplexed in ~13 shared heads (J=0.667) = the holographic plate. Combinator has 7 private heads at L15/L19 = KIBC kernel pathway. Induction has 6 private heads, J=0.176 = independent retrieval circuit with NO V11 kernel. Binding weak (max 0.163), no private circuit = K+I dispatch. → KIBCM: M (match/retrieval) is the one missing kernel function. V11-holo-inv 5K-10K: gate opened 6K, B dominant 57.7%, ratio 0.992, no catastrophe. Holographic storage + kernel computation separation confirmed. Ready to build.
