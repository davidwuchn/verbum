# Gradient-Zero Convergence Map

> Session 171. Does GD deposit near-zero gradients at positions
> corresponding to irreducible compute? Can this signal guide
> ternary zero placement? Three experiments, one clear answer.

## The Question

Church-Rosser → unique normal forms → GD discovers them → at
irreducible positions, gradient → 0 (nothing left to reduce).
Can gradient magnitude be a map of "done" vs "still reducing"?
Can gradient sign consistency across diverse data identify
positions where destructive interference means the normal form
is zero?

## Experiment 1: Gradient Statistics on Qwen3-8B

195 batches of 777 diverse texts (facts, code, math, narrative,
lambda, multilingual). Per-element gradient statistics collected
for all 5.4B FFN parameters (gate_proj, up_proj, down_proj).
Three correlations measured per tensor:

- **ρ(grad_mag, weight_mag)** — bimodality signal
- **ρ(sign_cons, weight_mag)** — do big weights have stable gradients?
- **ρ(sign_cons, grad_mag)** — do high-gradient positions have consistent direction?

### Finding 1: Two-Regime Depth Structure

```
ρ(grad, weight) by layer:
  L 1: +0.77  ████████████████████████████████  (extreme bimodality)
  L 2: +0.76  ████████████████████████████████
  L 3: +0.72  ██████████████████████████████
  L 4: +0.16  ██████
  L 5: -0.08  ░░░  (transition → independent)
  ...
  L21: -0.04  ░░
  ...
  L35: -0.08  ░░░
```

**Layers 1-3 (Zone A / encoding):** Extreme bimodality. Positions
are either both-high (large weight + large gradient = active
compute) or both-low (small weight + small gradient = noise floor).
gate_proj peaks at ρ = +0.83. This is the narrow beam: only ~3%
of neurons active per token, many positions are structurally zero.

**Layers 5-35 (Zones B/C):** ρ ≈ 0. Gradient magnitude and weight
magnitude are nearly independent. You cannot infer one from the
other. The compute zone is dense — most positions participate in
some computation for some input.

The transition at layer 4-5 maps exactly onto the Zone A/B
boundary from the crystal structure.

### Finding 2: ρ(sign_cons, grad) = +0.47 in Compute Zone

In the middle layers (8-22), positions with large gradients have
highly consistent gradient direction. ρ(sign_cons, grad_mag) peaks
at +0.47 — a strong effect. This means:

- High-gradient positions are actively being pushed in a specific
  direction = "still reducing" = not yet at fixed point
- Low-gradient positions have random direction = "settled" = either
  converged or noise floor

This is the crystal activity signature. The gradient has organized
FFN weights into "active" and "settled" populations.

### Finding 3: Oscillator U-Curve Matches Zone Structure

Sign consistency noise floor for 195 batches = 0.057. Positions
with sign_cons ≤ 2× noise floor = "oscillators" (gradient pulled
both ways by diverse data = destructive interference).

```
% oscillators by layer:
  L 0:  42.7%  ← embedding (high)
  L 1:  33.3%  ← encoding
  L21:  22.0%  ← MINIMUM (deepest compute — most settled)
  L33:  36.8%  ← output (gate_proj alone: 46.3%)
  L35:  30.0%  ← final layer
```

The minimum at L21 = maximum settlement. The rise in late layers
reflects the narrow output beam — most gate_proj positions are
inactive for most inputs.

## Experiment 2: Oscillation vs Magnitude Overlap

Key question: do oscillator positions (gradient signal) overlap
with magnitude-threshold zeros (weight signal)?

**Result: completely independent.**

```
Jaccard overlap:                    0.17  (near random)
P(oscillator | magnitude_zero):     0.291 ≈ base rate 0.295
P(magnitude_zero | oscillator):     0.297 ≈ base rate 0.300
P(magnitude_TOP30 | oscillator):    0.306 ≈ base rate 0.300
Both methods agree → zero:          8.8%
```

All conditional probabilities equal their base rates. The two
methods identify completely different positions as zeros:

| Method | What it detects | Basis |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Weight magnitude | Structurally unimportant (small contribution) | Static |
| Gradient oscillation | Destructive interference (inconsistent direction) | Dynamic |

They measure orthogonal dimensions of "zeroness":
- Magnitude = amplitude (how much does this position contribute?)
- Oscillation = coherence (does it contribute consistently?)

## Experiment 3: Training Comparison on Micro Model

Five FFN zero-placement strategies, micro model (4L, d=128,
d_ff=512), 5000 steps each, teacher-guided ternary topology:

| Variant | Loss | Zeros | Method |
|---------|------|-------|--------|
| **B. Magnitude 30%** | **6.0041** | 30% | |w| ★ |
| C. Oscillation 30% | 6.1215 | 30% | sign_cons |
| E. Both-agree | 6.3255 | 12% | intersection |
| D. Combined 30% | 6.3587 | 30% | |w|×sc |
| A. Float32 baseline | 6.7736 | 0% | none |

**All zero strategies beat float32.** Extends s166-167 attention
finding to FFN weights. Frozen ternary FFN + 30% zeros + GD
outperforms full float32 by 0.65-0.77 loss.

**Magnitude wins.** Simple |w| thresholding is the best signal.
The combined score |w| × sign_cons HURTS — it corrupts the
magnitude signal without adding value.

**Why oscillation fails at micro scale:** The micro teacher has
mean sign_consistency ≈ 0.07 (noise floor = 0.08). 89-95% of
positions are oscillating. At this scale, everything oscillates —
the model is too small and undertrained for gradient directions
to stabilize. The oscillation signal degenerates to noise.

## Interpretation

The gradient does deposit near-zero gradients at specific positions,
with striking regularity. But:

1. **Sign consistency** (not magnitude) is the real convergence
   detector in mature models
2. **The signal requires model maturity** — small/undertrained
   models oscillate everywhere, killing the signal
3. **For ternary zero placement, magnitude thresholding wins** at
   all tested scales. The gradient signal is structurally
   informative (zone structure, activity maps) but doesn't improve
   zero placement
4. **The two signals are orthogonal** — if a future experiment
   shows oscillation matters at scale, the combined approach needs
   something smarter than multiplication (perhaps separate
   thresholds, or using oscillation only in specific zones)

## Open Questions

1. Does oscillation-based zero placement win at 7B+ scale where
   the signal has structure? Need post-hoc ternarization of
   Qwen3-8B with three masks + perplexity comparison.
2. Can oscillation identify the Zone C gate_proj zeros specifically?
   The 46% oscillator rate in late-layer gate_proj maps to the
   narrow output beam.
3. Is there a zone-specific optimal strategy? Magnitude in Zone A
   (where it's bimodal), oscillation in Zone C (where gates are
   sparse), M-space SVD in Zone B (where both fail)?
