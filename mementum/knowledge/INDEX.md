# Knowledge Index

> Master reading order for the verbum project's synthesized knowledge.
> Read after `state.md`. Organized top-down: foundational → specific.

## How to Use This Index

1. **New session, familiar project:** Read `state.md` → skim this index → read Tier 1 if stale
2. **Brand new to the project:** Read pages 1–9 in order, then deep dives as needed
3. **Specific question:** Find the relevant page by topic, follow cross-references
4. **Adding knowledge:** Create page → add to appropriate tier → update this index
