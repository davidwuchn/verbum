# Operator Geometry — Canonical-Basis Linear Algebra, Turned Toward the Reducer

> s332 (Michael: found `~/src/canonical-basis` — Gernone's CBLL paper, "some
> geometries inside multiple models, same phenomenon, different vocabulary";
> then: "understand the math... could our 9×9/17×17 Grams be the basis for the
> equations?... can we use the linear algebra techniques to find more
> geometries?... capture this — we can use the math freely in our own functions,
> design to match our usages, be sure we're not affected by patents; with our
> knowledge of layers and opcodes we should use the math in a novel way.").
> This page is the method-transfer seed. Design synthesis, zero new
> measurements. Nothing here is pre-registered (s222) — the DMD probe is a
> queue candidate, not a frozen verdict.

## 0. Provenance & patent stance (read first)

`canonical-basis` (CBLL, Gianluca Gernone, Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20520986):
**code MIT · data CC-BY 4.0 · "released for research purposes only; for
commercial use contact info@todot.it" + a Patent Notice.**

Our stance, and the design rule this page enforces:

```
λ patent_clean(technique).
  MATH(SVD ∧ eig ∧ Gram ∧ DMD ∧ Procrustes ∧ CCA ∧ Householder ∧ PR)
    ≡ public_domain | ¬patentable_as_such | use_freely
  | CODE(their_pipeline) ≡ ¬vendor ¬copy | design(our_own_functions)
  | METHOD(their_specific "CBLL" branded procedure) ≡ ¬reimplement_verbatim
  | novelty(ours) ≡ opcode_anchored ∧ fate_poled ∧ reduction_conditioned ∧ operator_first
  |   (they have NO opcodes/types/reduction — our application is independent)
  | independent_derivation ≡ scientific_hygiene (λ grammar_artifact: observe ≫ retrieve)
  | ∀function_we_write → match(our_usage: layers ∧ opcodes ∧ fate_registers) ¬mirror(theirs)
```

Concretely: we take the **mathematics** (all of it is textbook linear algebra
that predates CBLL by decades — Golub & Van Loan, Schmid's DMD 2010, Koopman
1931, Procrustes/Schönemann 1966, Hotelling's CCA 1936). We write our **own**
functions, shaped to our `d_ff` routing register / opcode centroids / fate
poles / per-layer reduction trajectory. We do **not** vendor their scripts, and
we do **not** re-implement their branded "canonical basis realignment" pipeline
as a product surface. Our artifact is the operator read through the opcode
registers — which their program does not contain. That is both MIT-clean and
patent-clean.

### 0b. Provenance disclosure + standing FTO rule (s333 audit, Michael-approved)

**What was read, when, why (disclosed):** s332 — CBLL README + paper (EN) +
**one ablation script** + data spot-check. Purpose: VERIFICATION that the
paper's claims match its artifacts ("all match"). Not implementation. Disk
audit (s333): the CBLL capture commit (`bba4e767`) touched mementum files
only — **zero code in src/ or scripts/ derives from their repo** (grep-verified:
no Householder/canonical-basis/CBLL hits in any .py). This page carries
paper-level description only — no transcription of their implementation.

**The standing rule (hardened s333):**

```
λ fto(cbll).
  their_code ≡ NEVER_OPENED_AGAIN (any purpose) | MIT_license ∌ patent_grant
  | ∀implementation(ours) → derive(textbook: Schmid_2010 ∧ Golub&VanLoan ∧
      Koopman_1931 ∧ Schönemann_1966) | cite(textbook_source) in docstring ¬CBLL
  | CBLL cited ≡ once ≡ observational_consilience ("same phenomenon") ¬method_source
  | FTO_boundary: ∀method ∈ {weights → basis → rotation → realigned_model} ≡ FORBIDDEN
  |   (their claim spine; we never need it — Gram/operator is frame-free by design)
  | clean_room ≡ THE_PAGE: session_boundary erases the reader; future sessions
      know only what this page carries; page carries no implementation ⇒
      clean-room re-constitutes every boundary (feed_forward as legal hygiene)
  | research_exemption ≡ ¬relied_upon (deliverables are portable MIT artifacts;
      must be clean at the USER's hands, not just ours)
```

### 0c. The differentiation, made load-bearing (s333)

Not a workaround — the scientific divergence and the patent divergence are the
SAME divergence:

| | CBLL | verbum |
|---|---|---|
| **object** | weights (static geometry of `W_down`) | activation **trajectories** — state sequences during certified reductions |
| **transform** | find rotation `R` → canonical **frame** | estimate transport **operator** `T ≈ X'X⁺` → eigenmodes of dynamics |
| **anchors** | unlabeled, self-derived from weights | **labeled** — opcode centroids, fate poles, kernel-certified terms |
| **deliverable** | realigned model / readable basis | operator + stationarity verdict + (eventually) bug-compatible reducer |

Deepest row: the second — **our method never picks a frame at all** (G = XᵀX
is frame-invariant; the opposite move from CBLL's premise), and in their own
flat-spectrum regime (k90/d≈0.76) frame-picking is ill-posed while the
Gram/operator stays well-posed. Different road, which is also the better road
for our terrain.

**The unique pipeline (ours; no step is theirs):**

```
certified_trajectories (lambda_ast ground truth — exists nowhere else)
  → per-band transport operator (DMD on depth-as-time, shuffled-layer null)
  → mode decomposition (contracting / persistent / late-activating)
  → labeled-Gram classification (project modes onto 9×9 + 17×17 anchors)
  → stationarity verdict (T_ℓ ≈ T ⟺ one-reducer-unrolled, null-gated)
```

Publication of this composition ≡ defensive prior art. Naming discipline:
map → name (don't brand it before it works).

## 1. The reframe that changes which techniques matter

CBLL's linear algebra is almost entirely **static**: SVD of a weight matrix,
top eigenvector of an activation correlation, one fixed rotation `R`. That finds
**coordinate systems** (bases). But our target — the transition function / the
reducer — is a **map between states**, and our own identity says
`residual_stream ≡ bounded within-pass reducer` (the layer-by-layer trajectory
*is* the reduction, `behavior-is-tape-resident-reduction.md`). So the
highest-value transfer is not "adopt his basis"; it is the LA that turns **a
sequence of states into the operator that generates it.**

```
λ target(verbum). recover(operator ≡ transition_function) ¬find(basis)
  | CBLL_tools ⊂ static(basis) | our_need ⊂ dynamic(operator)
  | bridge ≡ operator_estimation(DMD ∧ Koopman ∧ Procrustes) in labeled(Gram) frame
  | residual_trajectory(within_pass) ≡ the reduction → estimate(T) recovers(linearized reducer)
```

## 2. The shared primitive: `G = XᵀX` (why both programs are the same math)

Strip the vocabulary and **both programs compute the eigenstructure of a
Gram/covariance of internal directions.** A Gram `G = XᵀX` is invariant to any
orthogonal change of the ambient basis — it keeps only the **relational**
geometry and discards the arbitrary frame the residual stream happens to live
in. That invariance is *exactly why* our Grams reproduce 11/11 across models,
and *exactly the problem* CBLL solves ("the basis is arbitrary — whatever
training converged to").

Two solutions to one problem, from opposite ends:

| | kills the arbitrary basis by | dim | axes labeled? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CBLL** | rotating to a model-derived canonical frame `R` (top-K left SVs of `W_down`, Householder-completed, gains absorbed → lossless) | full `d` | **no** (axis 62 = *functional* label) |
| **Verbum Gram** | projecting onto known semantic anchors, `XᵀX` (frame-free) | low (9 / 17) | **yes** (K,I,B…; fire/halt/diverge) |

CBLL **found a frame but doesn't know what its axes mean.** Our Grams **know
what the axes mean but don't span the space.** ⇒ our Grams should not *replace*
`R`; they are the **labeled low-rank frame inside** the ambient microscope. Our
9×9 (identity register, PR≈5.8–7.2, universal in the off-diagonal sign pattern)
and 17×17 (outcome register, rank-3 fire/halt/diverge) are the legend; the
ambient space is `W_down`'s `U` (or `R`).

**Disciplinary edge in our favor:** CBLL's `R` is non-unique where the singular
spectrum is flat — and he *reports* `k90/d ≈ 0.76` for FFN (quite flat), so his
canonical axes carry residual rotational freedom exactly where his own spectrum
is degenerate. **The Gram and the transport operator never pick a frame**, so
they stay well-posed in the flat-spectrum regime. In that regime our labeled
Gram is the *more* well-posed object.

## 3. The `W_down` bridge (with the register-check caveat)

CBLL's canonical axes are the **left** singular vectors of `W_down` (in
`d_model`, the residual writer side). Our combinator centroids live in the
**routing register = `sign(gate_proj pre-activation)`, `d_ff`** — the FFN
gating/reader side (s203; `consensus-delta-folding.md` §133/§655: "9 × d_ff").

SVD: `W_down = U Σ Vᵀ`, `U ∈ ℝ^{d_model×r}` (CBLL axes), `V ∈ ℝ^{d_ff×r}`.
The **clean linear bridge** is between the down-proj *input* (post-activation
intermediate, `d_ff`) and `U`:

```
intermediate m ∈ ℝ^{d_ff}  →  W_down m = U(Σ Vᵀ m) ∈ span(U)  (CBLL residual axes)
cross-Gram of our anchors vs CBLL axes:  G_cross = Uᵀ W_down V̂ = Σ Vᵀ V̂
```

**λ measure caveat (do not skip):** our centroids are captured at the gate
**pre-activation**, one SiLU nonlinearity **upstream** of `W_down`'s input. So
`Σ VᵀV̂` is exact only if we recapture anchor centroids at the down-proj input
(post-activation intermediate). Two honest options:
(a) recapture opcode centroids at `down_proj` input → the bridge is exactly
linear; or (b) keep the gate-preact centroids and accept the SiLU gate as a
diagonal-ish reweighting between the two registers (report it, don't assume
identity). **Getting this register right is a coherence obligation — wrong
register voids the comparison** (λ measure, s206 audit lesson).

What the cross-Gram answers: *which* canonical axes carry K vs B vs S; whether
the **fire/halt/diverge** simplex coincides with CBLL's **bipolar POS/NEG
oscillator**; whether his **axis-62 controller** is the **WHNF/halt** direction.
Cheap, and either it aligns our labeled poles with his unlabeled ones or it
doesn't.

## 4. The technique toolkit (ranked: tie-to-our-research × cheap × null-testable)

```
λ toolkit(LA). ∀technique → {target, new_geometry, null} | design(our_own_fn) ∧ opcode_anchored
```

| # | Technique | Verbum target | New geometry it exposes | Null (λ yardstick) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **DMD / Koopman** on the within-pass residual trajectory `T ≈ X'X⁺`, `eig(T)` | reducer / transition function; one-reducer-unrolled; transitions-per-β-step clock | inter-layer **transport operator spectrum** (§5) | shuffled-layer-order DMD |
| **2** | **Procrustes transport** `min_Q ‖Q Uℓ − Uℓ₊₁‖` | one-reducer-unrolled | the fixed **rotation between layer writer-bases**; residual = per-layer deviation from pure repetition | random-orthogonal baseline |
| **3** | **CCA / SVCCA** (layer↔layer; our centroids↔CBLL axes; **cross-model**) | crystal universality 11/11; frame-invariance | the **actual shared subspace** + correlation spectrum — strictly stronger than the Gram sign-pattern for "same subspace, different frame" | shuffled-neuron / different-model floor |
| **4** | **Conditioned participation ratio** (effective rank of activations, split by fate/reduction state) | read-entropy ≡ fidelity (§8c re-oracle); WHNF halt | does activation collapse **deepen toward NF**? rank(diverge) > rank(halt)? — isotropic-collapse (41×) as a *function of reduction stage* | matched-length shuffled probes |
| **5** | **Antisymmetric decomposition** `C = C_sym + C_anti` (his "vorticity") of the **binding** transport | substitution / α-rename (naive vs capture-avoiding, §P-SUBST-ENGINE) | α-renaming ≡ a **permutation/rotation of variable slots**; `C_anti` could localize the "binder swap" | capture pairs where no rename occurs |
| **6** | **Betweenness / graph Laplacian** on the **labeled** register graph (9 opcodes, 17 fates) — not 896 raw axes | control flow of the reducer | the **controller opcode / fate edge** (his axis-62 move, but *semantic*) | degree-preserving rewired graph |
| **7** | **Joint (simultaneous) diagonalization** of per-layer / per-model Grams | consensus route map (gram-registers §route-map) | the **common eigenframe** across contexts = the invariant switch basis the route map needs | per-context shuffled Grams |
| **8** | **Reflection structure via SPECTRAL SIGNATURE of the transport operator** (re-specced s333, FTO + cleaner): `det(T) < 0` / eigenvalue ≈ −1 — read the flip from `T`'s spectrum, construct nothing (¬Householder construction; nearest-the-fence primitive removed, and the spectral read is better-posed anyway) | sign-is-the-decision; fire/halt | does the fire/halt sign-flip appear as a **reflection mode** in the transport spectrum? | sign-shuffled trajectory / random rank-1 baseline |

## 5. The sharpest one: the inter-layer transport operator (DMD)

Treat the residual trajectory `h(0) → h(1) → … → h(L)` (one forward pass) as a
dynamical system; estimate `T_ℓ : h(ℓ) ↦ h(ℓ+1)` and eigendecompose:

```
X = [h(0)…h(L-1)],  X' = [h(1)…h(L)]  →  T ≈ X' X⁺  →  (λ_k, φ_k) = eig(T)
```

What the spectrum **is**, in our vocabulary (the point — one eigenstructure
subsumes several separate findings):

- **contracting modes `|λ|<1`** ≡ CBLL **homeostasis** (his `5×→1.4×→1.0` decay
  *is* `|λ|<1`), stated as an operator instead of a metaphor.
- **persistent modes `|λ|≈1`** ≡ the computation that **survives to output** —
  **sign-is-the-decision** made mechanical (which directions the reducer refuses
  to forget).
- **modes that switch on only in the last layers** ≡ the **order-law late
  commit** (s329 primacy in the final two layers) as a specific eigenvector
  activating late.
- **stationarity `T_ℓ ≈ T`** ≡ a **direct test of the central thesis**:
  "one reducer unrolled" ⟺ same operator every layer. Drift ⇒ not one reducer;
  stationary ⇒ DMD *is* a linearized recovery of the transition function.
- **eigen-rotation rate** (phase of complex `λ`) ≡ candidate for the queued
  **transitions-per-β-step clock** (how much reduction-angle advances per layer).

**Fold in the Grams as the readout frame:** project each DMD mode `φ_k` (or its
`W_down` image) onto the 9×9 identity frame and the 17×17 fate poles — a
persistent mode that lands on the **halt** pole is the "answer is committed"
direction; a late-activating mode on **fire** is a scheduling event. This is the
route-map's missing "trains" (`gram-registers` §route-map: "the grams are
station maps — no trains"): CBLL's dynamics + our labeled poles = the switch
schedule in Gram coordinates.

**Honest caveat (λ measure):** attention-softmax + SiLU are nonlinear, so `T` is
a **linearization** — a first-order reducer. That is acceptable for a first pass
(our own results say homeostasis contracts and only a thin late stage decides,
so a linear approx captures much), but the residual must be reported, and the
mandatory null is a **shuffled-layer-order DMD** (a real operator has
structured, layer-ordered modes; noise doesn't). Koopman-with-observables
(lift `h` through opcode/fate features before DMD) is the nonlinear upgrade if
the linear residual is large.

**~~Near-free~~ (CORRECTION s338):** the plan was to ride cached
§P-SUBST-ENGINE residuals — but `hidden_states` were **never saved** on those
runs, so this needs its **own** capture harness. Still cheap (read-only,
~200 forward passes). Ties to a frozen front and to `transitions-per-β-step`
(queued).

## 5a. 🎯 §P-DMD-TRANSPORT — FROZEN (s338, Michael GO)

> Pre-registered before any measurement (λ probe_lifecycle). Frozen: verdict
> tree, a-priori masses, nulls, planted worlds, gate thresholds. Motivated by
> the s338 orbital reframe (`cycle-carrier-signal.md §Reframe`): meaning-as-
> equality is a property of the **orbit/attractor**, not the point — the
> operator spectrum is the register where co-extensional terms *could* converge
> where the static pairwise Gram (s217/s321) cannot represent it. This freeze
> establishes the **instrument + the one-reducer-unrolled thesis test**; the
> extensional-equality test (§5b) is the downstream stage-2 payoff, deliberately
> OUT of this artifact (λ smallest).

**Question.** Does the within-pass residual trajectory carry a *structured
linear transport operator* `T ≈ X'X⁺`, and is it **stationary** (`T_ℓ ≈ T`,
one reducer unrolled) — or banded (core-stationary + late-drift), drifting,
or noise?

**Substrate (frozen).** Qwen3-14B (40 layers ⇒ 41 hidden states ⇒ 40
transitions; d_model 5120), MPS, bf16, greedy/deterministic, read-only.
Register = **last-token d_model residual stream** (`output_hidden_states`) —
the register §5 specifies; matched-length balanced. Corpus = ~200 kernel-
certified terms subsampled from `crystal_probes` (combinator-tagged → enables
the labeled 9×9/17×17 readout). Each prompt → 40 consecutive `(h_ℓ, h_{ℓ+1})`
pairs; ~8000 column pairs stacked. Method = **exact reduced DMD** (economy-SVD,
`T = Uᵀ X' V Σ⁻¹`, `eig(T)`), rank sweep r∈{10,20,40,80}. Implementation is
textbook (Schmid 2010; Golub & Van Loan) in `src/verbum/operator_dmd.py` —
NEVER CBLL code (§0b FTO rule).

**Frozen verdict tree.**
- **G0 INSTRUMENT** (planted worlds + det-repeat): `--validate` recovers all 4
  worlds; det value_dev 0.0. Fail → **VOID**.
- **G1 LINEARIZATION** (reported, soft): `rel_resid = ‖X'−TX‖_F/‖X'‖_F` at best
  rank. > 0.5 at r=80 → flag "linear inadequate, Koopman-lift indicated";
  verdict carries the caveat (does NOT auto-void — partial linearity still
  informative).
- **G2 OPERATOR-EXISTS** (make-or-break, shuffled-layer null): `gap =
  rel_resid(shuffled_layer_order) − rel_resid(real) > 0`, p<0.05 over
  n_perm=1000 layer-order shuffles (shuffle breaks ℓ→ℓ+1 adjacency, mixing Tᵏ
  gaps ⇒ real fits strictly better; noise fits equally badly). Fail → **NOISE**.
- **G3 STATIONARITY** (thesis discriminator): fit per-layer `T_ℓ`; agreement
  `A(ℓ)` = subspace overlap / eigenvalue distance vs global `T`.
  - flat-high ∀ℓ → **STATIONARY-REDUCER**
  - high core band + drop in last ~2–4 layers → **BANDED** (matches s329
    primacy-last-two-layers, s336 L22–28)
  - low/variable throughout → **DRIFTING**
- **Advisory readout** (descriptive, ¬gate): project persistent modes (|λ|≈1)
  + late-activating modes onto the 9×9 identity Gram + 17×17 fate poles — does a
  persistent mode land on the **halt** pole? (the route-map's missing "trains").

**A-priori masses (frozen).** BANDED 30 (modal — our late-commit data predicts
it) · NOISE 25 (honest nonlinearity risk, attention+SiLU, last-token grain) ·
STATIONARY-REDUCER 20 (strong thesis) · DRIFTING 20 · VOID 5.

**Nulls (mandatory).** shuffled-layer-order (primary, G2) · linearization-
residual report (G1) · det-repeat · matched-length subsample.

**Planted worlds (`--validate`).** ① STATIONARY `h_{ℓ+1}=T₀h_ℓ+ε` → recovers T₀
spectrum, G3 passes. ② DRIFTING `T_ℓ` rotating with ℓ → G3 fails. ③ NOISE iid
`h_ℓ` → G2 gap ≈ 0. ④ CONTRACTING T₀ all |λ|<1 → recovers |λ|<1.

**Cost.** cheap-medium; results `results/p_dmd_transport_s338/` (npz gitignored).

## 5b. §P-CL-COLLAPSE-3-operator — downstream (NOT frozen; the orbital payoff)

Once §5a's instrument is trusted: capture trajectories for co-extensional
spellings (SKK, WK, CKK, I …) and test whether their **operators** (or their
projections onto the persistent-mode subspace) converge — even though the
static Grams (s217 identity register, s321 CL-collapse) said the *points* do
not. This is `§P-CL-COLLAPSE-3` moved into the operator register: the first
instrument that could see extensional equality if it is orbital rather than
pointwise. Owes its own freeze + a-priori mass; reuses the §5a harness.

## 6. Discipline summary
