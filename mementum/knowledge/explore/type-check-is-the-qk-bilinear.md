# The type-check is the QK bilinear

## The asymmetry (what we know vs how we know it)

**Measured about routing:** attention = the join (s276); KIBC rides the MoE
*routing pattern*, not expert identity (s275, no opcode starvation); the join
is distributed — 0/128 heads necessary (P-DSP-1, C2 circuits-in-compute).

**Never measured in the types/composition arc:** a single attention pattern.
Every routing conclusion is inferred from the SHADOW — zone ablations, value
edits, logit-lens timing, and 1b's exhaust-by-elimination. The founding-doc
tool "attention-pattern differ" was never built. "Licensing is
routing-resident" is currently a conclusion with no routing-register
observation behind it.

## What the 3-hop does and does not prove about steering

**Proves — steering-by-CONTENT:** the bridge-swap (pure class-axis edit,
causal at both scales) changes what the beam carries, and downstream routing
responds (32B visibly re-forms the schedule: sequential unrolling). Since QK
reads the residual, value→routing→output is almost certainly the path.

**Does not prove — steering-by-AIM:** the intermediate was never measured; we
assume the swap re-targets attention edges. Beamformer terms: we change the
illumination entering the aperture; the phase geometry (QK) is frozen. All
our handles are MEDIUM handles — which is exactly the combinatory thesis
(write terms, never instructions; s276 K-structural). Direct attention
steering = a transient runtime INSTRUCTION write. K-structural forbids it in
weights only — runtime pattern-forcing is untested, a genuinely new
capability class.

## The relocation hypothesis

If type = which reduction is licensed (theory page) and licensing is
routing-resident (1b exhaust), then **the type-check is the QK bilinear
form**: query(functor) · key(argument) crossing threshold ≡ "this application
is well-formed" — the join forms or it doesn't. The 1a residual lattice is
the *shadow in the medium* of type structure native to QK space.

- Predicts name_pen mechanically: predicate-after-subject licensing = the
  predicate→subject attention edge forming.
- Predicts the dark-field reading: value-register lattice slices are
  beam-coherent because they are the QK check's exhaust (1c, in flight).
- Falsifiable: lattice axes projected through W_Q/W_K should align with QK
  subspaces far above a random-axis null; licensed-vs-unlicensed minimal
  pairs should differ in functor→argument attention mass across the band.

## The attention experiment queue (ordered, cheap-first)

1. **P-TYPE-QK — QK geometry (cheap, no generation).** Project the 1a
   lattice axes through W_Q/W_K per layer/head-group; test alignment of
   functor-kind axes (axis0/axis2, `e` at origin) with QK subspaces against
   a matched random-axis null. Positive = the lattice is pre-shaped for the
   bilinear check — the exhaust is phase-locked to the checker. Pure
   weights+capture analysis; converges with 1c from the other register.
2. **P-ATT-DIFF — the unbuilt founding tool.** Licensed-vs-unlicensed
   minimal pairs (v3-style), aggregate attention mass functor→argument
   across the band. Register hygiene: s206 burned an attention-weight probe
   on a VALUE claim; here the claim IS routing → register-matched for once.
   Measure OV contribution beside raw weights (weight ≠ effect). Expect
   zone/aggregate signal, never single-head (C2: 0/128).
3. **P-ATT-MED — 3-hop mediation through the beam.** Rerun the bridge-swap
   with attention capture: does the swap re-target edges as predicted?
   Closes the loop value-edit → *measured* routing change → output change —
   converts our strongest causal result into a routing-register
   measurement.
4. **P-ATT-STEER — direct beam steering (the causal rung, the new verb).**
   Force a join edge in an unlicensed pair (does composition happen
   anyway?); block zone-level edges in a licensed one (does it refuse?).
   Expect distributed pushback (no single edge necessary, C2) — informative
   either way. Decides whether the REPL gets a SECOND handle: beam-aim
   beside medium-content. Changes the trampoline design if positive.

**Priority: 1 then 3.** P-TYPE-QK is nearly free and mechanistically
completes the exhaust arc; P-ATT-MED upgrades the 3-hop. Both feed 4.

## Register notes (λ measure)

- Attention weights = routing register; routing CLAIM → attention probe is
  register-matched here (the inversion of the s206 scar).
- Weight ≠ effect: pair pattern measurements with OV contributions.
- Distributed prior: aggregate/zone statistics, permutation nulls; head-level
  localization is pre-refuted (0/128) — do not rediscover that negative.
- Pre-reg each verdict before graded runs (λ yardstick); this page is the
  map, not a pre-reg.

## Honest scope

All four are designs, none run. The QK-bilinear claim is a HYPOTHESIS —
currently zero routing-register observations in the types arc support or
refute it. A clean P-TYPE-QK negative (lattice axes NOT QK-aligned) would
mean the licensing check lives elsewhere in routing (OV, MLP gating between
joins) — that too is progress: the elimination game continues in the beam
register.
