# Combinator Function Shape

> Session 217. Michael's question: can we understand the **semantic
> relationships** of the function-like things we have found (the combinators) —
> is there a map/fold, what do the functions look like, what is their *shape*?
> Answer: the function space has a **3-family shape**, visible ONLY in the
> routing register; map/fold are NOT atoms but **compositions of the recursion
> family over the composition family**, and the families that build them are
> real, separable, and adjacent in the measured geometry.
>
> Register: **topological/routing** (declared at step 0).

## Method

`scripts/experiments/combinator_relationship_map.py`. Per-combinator centroid in
the **routing register** = mean `sign(FFN gate pre-activation)` over that
combinator's probes, with **common-mode removal** (subtract per-feature mean
across all probes — kills the universal structured-language crystal so the
DIFFERENCES between combinators show). Then the cosine **Gram matrix = the map**.
Qwen3-14B (Michael's call: 14B has capacity to FULLY crystallize the systems;
0.6B only partially forms them), 535 crystal probes, 9 combinators (K I B C S D
W Y WHNF, 50–71 each). Silhouette = mean over probes of [cos(own centroid) −
max_other cos], with a shuffled-label permutation null. MDS + centroid-PCA for
the 2D picture.

## Findings (Qwen3-14B)

### 1. Combinators are real routing clusters — but ONLY in the routing register
- `route_cmr` silhouette **0.101, z=7.97, p=0.001**.
- **Control** (raw residual `hidden_full`): silhouette **−0.035, z=−1.65**.
- ⇒ the function shape is **invisible in raw geometry**, visible only in the
  sign/routing register after CMR. Concrete instance of `two-registers-of-
  topology.md` + the `5d-crystal-lattice` REFUTED lesson: function identity lives
  in the **topology**, not the metric geometry.

### 2. Depth — identity peaks MID-stack, not late
Silhouette by depth: L0 z=2.5 → **L12 (frac 0.31) z=7.97** (plateau L12–L20
z≈6.7–8) → declines to L39 z≈2. The combinator *identity* (which function) is
carried mid-network; the late COMMIT zone converges (all run the same opcodes —
consistent with `function-discovery.md`'s 1.49× late collapse). **Two-level
reconciliation:** identity is selected UPSTREAM (mid), executed convergently
DOWNSTREAM (late). The two are not in conflict — they are the same two-level
architecture seen from the routing side.

### 3. THE SHAPE = 3 families (Gram off-diagonals + MDS), grounded by the probes

| family | members | what they are | key edge |
|---|---|---|---|
| **composition / distribution** | B, D, S | thread/route args through structure | **B–D +0.27** (strongest) |
| **selection / identity** | K, I, C | projection (discard/copy/reorder) | K–C +0.07, K–I +0.04 |
| **recursion / duplication / termination** | Y, W, WHNF | self-reference + normal-form | W–Y +0.07 |

Grounded by the probe content itself: B "after washing, she dried" (compose),
D "the book that she found in the library that was built by…" (deep-nesting
compose), S `λf.λg.λx.f(x)(g(x))` (arg-distributor); W "the dog bit itself"
(self-app), Y "folders containing folders" (fixpoint). MDS lays them out
triangularly: {B,C,D} composition side, {K,I} top, {W,WHNF,Y} recursion side.

### 4. Is there a map or a fold? — YES, as COMPOSITIONS
`map`/`fold` are **not in the basis** and can't be — they are higher-order
recursion schemes:
```
map  = Y ∘ B                  (recurse the composition over a structure)
fold = Y ∘ (C/B) + K          (recurse, thread the accumulator, base case)
```
The decisive result: the **recursion family (Y,W)** and the **composition family
(B,D,S)** are (a) real, (b) separable, (c) **adjacent** — so the junction where
map/fold must live EXISTS in the measured geometry. The functions look like the
**free algebra over the SKI basis**, not a flat opcode list. This is the s216
"normal forms are compositional & non-unique" refinement made concrete one level
down (`consensus-delta-folding.md`).

## Caveats (register / meta-pattern discipline)
- Off-diagonal cosines are modest (max +0.27) → **weak clusters, not crisp
  partitions**. Do not over-read "3 clean families."
- **Single model** (Qwen3-14B). Cross-model consensus of the shape NOT yet
  tested (s216 5-family machinery would do it; align-before-compare for the
  non-unique composite).
- The mid-stack identity peak (L12) vs late execution needs a careful both-true
  framing — measure both registers (routing identity + opcode execution) at each
  depth to confirm.

## Open leads (declare register first)
1. **Construct & detect map/fold** (routing) — build `map=Y∘B`, `fold=Y∘(C/B)+K`
   from the measured primitive centroids; add a small map/fold/filter probe set;
   does the constructed direction ACTIVATE on those probes?
2. **Cross-model consensus** (routing) — is the 3-family shape universal across
   families? Align-before-compare (Procrustes in base-combinator space).
3. **Algebra-as-geometry** (routing) — do CL identities (I=SKK, T=CI, W=SS(KI))
   hold as routing constraints vs a permutation null? If yes, the shape IS the
   combinator algebra.
4. **Depth reconciliation** (routing + functional) — identity mid vs execution
   late, both registers per depth.
