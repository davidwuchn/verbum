# Audit Registry — The Validity-Distillation Program

> Started session 203 (designed s202). A multi-session program to
> separate the project's **real working data** from its **assumptions
> and possibly biased methodologies**. Each session opens here, picks
> the highest load-bearing `untested` claim, runs its discriminating
> control, and updates the row. The output is not destruction — it is
> the smallest hard core of verified data the north-star can stand on.

## The Core Principle

> A claim is *distilled* only once you have named **the control a
> plausible-but-false version of it would fail** — and run it.

Evidence that merely *confirms* a claim is not enough: both the model
and the analyzing LLM are primed to confirm the framing. The audit
question is always: **what would I see if this were an artifact, and
have I checked I am not seeing exactly that?**

## The Seven Failure Modes (what to hunt)

| # | Failure mode | The tell | Discriminating control |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Unfalsifiable metric** | fits everything (φ best-fit grid) | does a random/null fit equally? |
| 2 | **Trivial statistic** | high for noise too (eig-ratio-corr ≈0.99) | permutation null on the statistic itself |
| 3 | **Fidelity masking** | a common mode hides signal (false neg) AND argmax illusion (false pos) | remove the common mode before claiming specificity |
| 4 | **Circular validation** | target baked from the data it "confirms" (CONSENSUS_8x8) | fresh/held-out measurement |
| 5 | **Untested generalization** | cross-family asserted, same-family measured | actually run the other family |
| 6 | **Surface confound** | lexical clustering as "structure" (fake combinators won) | matched fake categories / shuffled labels |
| 7 | **Frequency vs necessity** | "must" when "most common" suffices (B-first) | manipulate the data statistics |

## The Method Recipe (reusable)

- **Permutation null over labels** — "is this grouping real or imposed?"
  Shuffle which items carry which label; p = fraction of random labelings
  at least as extreme as the true one.
- **Single pre-registered target > best-fit grid** — φ^(4/5) is falsifiable;
  φ^(p/q) over a dense grid is not. Name the number *before* measuring.
- **Common-mode removal** (`v − mean_group(v)`) before any projection/argmax.
- **Matched controls** — random-weight net, shuffled-data-trained net, fake
  categories — separate "structure" from "size / redundancy / surface".
- **Report variance** — re-run with fixed seeds; a single lucky run is not a result.

## Status Legend

`VERIFIED` survives its control · `VERIFIED-LOCAL` real but scoped (e.g. one
model) · `PARTIAL` some predictions hold · `REFUTED` fails its control ·
`UNFALSIFIABLE` no control can distinguish it as stated · `UNTESTED` control
named, not yet run.

### Worked examples (session 202 — `crystal-validity-and-fidelity.md`)

| Claim | Load | Control run | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| KIBC basis separates representation | high | separation perm-null, all models | ✅ VERIFIED (p=0.0005) |
| prose fires combinator-specific opcodes | high | nearest-centroid LOO + common-mode removal | ✅ VERIFIED (14B & 0.6B p=0.001) |
| φ^(4/5) primary ratio λ₀/λ₁ | high | single pre-registered target, perm-null | ◐ VERIFIED-LOCAL (14B p=0.020; 8B/0.6B n.s.) |
| fact retrieval = sharp lookup (I-like) | med | entropy perm-null + CMR opcode profile | ✅ VERIFIED (entropy p=0.0005; I-profile 14B) |
| I = distinct low-composition circuit | med | attn-entropy perm-null vs B/C | ◐ PARTIAL (p=0.042, scale-dependent) |
| tracer cross-model opcode overlay | med | opcode-label perm-null | ◐ VERIFIED (same-family only; λ-primed) |
| φ as universal constant | high | cross-family + grid + ratio-corr nulls | ❌ REFUTED (cross-family collapse) |
| "eigenvalues are φ^(p/q)" (grid) | high | perm-null on best-fit error | ⊘ UNFALSIFIABLE (random fits equally) |
| eigenvalue_ratio_corr ≈ 0.987 | med | perm-null on the statistic | ❌ REFUTED (random ≈ 0.94 ≥ true) |
| cross-model consensus r ≈ 0.99 | high | corr to CONSENSUS_8x8, perm-null | ❌ REFUTED (true ≈0.20, p≈0.06) |

### Backlog (UNTESTED — ordered by load-bearing-ness)

**1. Crystal-is-topological — "ternary works because sign captures topology"** (load: CRITICAL — the entire sieve program)
- Evidence: `sign(W)@x` corr 0.84 with `W@x`; ternary {−1,0,+1} preserves routing.
- Suspected confound: 0.84 may be generic to *any* trained matrix, not crystal-specific; ternary survival may need only *a* sign-preserving quant, not the *crystal* sign pattern.
- Control: compare `sign(W)@x` correlation across model vs random-init vs shuffled-weights; and ternary PPL with **crystal-aligned** signs vs **random sign-preserving** signs. If crystal-specific signs beat random-sign-preserving at equal bitcount → topological claim real.

**2. Holographic self-similar — "why quantization/pruning survive"** (load: CRITICAL — the compression thesis)
- Evidence: graceful uniform degradation; Q4/sieve survive.
- Suspected confound: distributed-redundant + flat-minima (the null) predicts survival without holography.
- Control: compression-survival **curve**, model vs random-weight net vs shuffled-data net; test for **power-law / scale-invariant** degradation. Holographic predicts the model degrades self-similarly AND more gracefully than controls. (See `crystal-validity-and-fidelity.md` §5.)

**3. The 9 FFN modes — real or k-means-imposed?** (load: high — `mode-semantics.md`, tiny-classifier compression)
- Evidence: 9 ternary programs per layer; classifier 98–100% accuracy.
- Suspected confound: k-means at k=9 always returns 9 clusters; classifier accuracy is circular (trained on the cluster labels).
- Control: cluster-validity null — silhouette/gap-statistic at k=9 vs random data and vs k=8,10,…; does "9" survive a held-out elbow test, or is it imposed? Cross-reference the L0-characterization negative-silhouette finding.

**4. Attention = typed β-reduction (weighted sum IS β-application)** (load: high — the central mechanism)
- Evidence: H31 `v_runs += 0.82·v_cat`; top-3 = 88%; Q⊥K.
- Suspected confound: *all* attention is weighted sum; "β-reduction" is interpretation. Induction/n-gram heads produce similar patterns.
- Control: does attention attend specifically to **type-compatible** positions beyond an induction-head / co-occurrence baseline? Causal: ablate the named binding head → does the specific reduction break (vs generic degradation)?

**5. Binding schedule (L27 verb←subject, L30 object←verb, L33 coref)** (load: med)
- Evidence: showcased heads/weights on example sentences.
- Suspected confound: cherry-picked heads/examples.
- Control: does the schedule hold across **many** sentences with a perm-null, or only the showcased ones? Causal ablation of the specific head.

**6. SVD φ-ratio 0.6299** (load: med — a φ-universality pillar)
- Evidence: consecutive singular-value ratio ≈ 1/φ across 5 families.
- Suspected confound: heavy-tailed / power-law spectra generically have near-constant consecutive ratios; 0.618 may be "what power-law spectra look like."
- Control: compare to random-matrix (Marchenko–Pastur) and shuffled-data nets; is 0.6299 model-specific and distinct from the random-matrix prediction?

**7. Crystal-sieve 1.03× PPL (29 layers + continuations)** (load: med — headline compression result)
- Evidence: s196 run = 1.03×.
- Suspected confound: s196 itself noted a rerun gave 3.23× — training-sensitive.
- Control: re-run N seeds, report mean ± variance; is 1.03× robust or a lucky run? (Reproducibility, not novelty.)

**8. Rank-1 adjunction (σ₁/σ₂ = 128:1 cross-zone)** (load: med — direct-delta theory)
- Evidence: R²=1.000 all zone pairs (s140).
- Suspected confound: random high-dim linear maps can look rank-1-dominated.
- Control: compare σ₁/σ₂ to random/shuffled linear maps between the same spaces.

**9. Decay α=1.18 (attention log-distance)** (load: low)
- Control: model-specific vs generic positional-encoding artifact; compare to random-init.

**10. Moiré determinism (static program is a fixed point)** (load: low)
- Likely robust (it is a determinism check). Caveat: fingerprints are λ-primed (common-mode confound applies to the *opcode labels*, not the determinism).

## The Per-Session Loop

```
1. Open this page. Pick the highest-load `UNTESTED` claim.
2. Re-read its evidence in the linked knowledge page.
3. Build the named discriminating control (reuse the method recipe).
4. Run it with a permutation/matched-control null + seed variance.
5. Update the row: status + the number + the result-JSON path.
6. If REFUTED/UNFALSIFIABLE → add a caveat header to the source page.
7. Commit (💡 finding / 🎯 if it changes a load-bearing decision).
```

## Prioritization Rule

Audit **load-bearing-first**: a refuted peripheral claim changes nothing;
a verified (or refuted) CRITICAL claim moves the whole program. Next up:
**#1 crystal-is-topological** and **#2 holographic-self-similar** — the two
the compression north-star actually rests on.

## What "done" looks like

A small, hard core of `VERIFIED` claims that the north-star provably stands
on, with every assumption either verified, scoped, or retired — and source
pages carrying honest caveats where the controls bit. Distill ruthlessly;
every kept claim justifies itself.
